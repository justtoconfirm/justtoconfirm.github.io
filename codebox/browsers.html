            <ul>
                <li><strong>Released:</strong> 2015</li>
                <li><strong>Rendering Engine:</strong> EdgeHTML (now replaced by Chromium-based Blink)</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Formally codenamed <strong>Project Spartan/Anaheim</strong>, Microsoft Edge is the replacement browser for Internet Explorer (IE).</p>

            <p>Edge is the default web browser on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile and Xbox One consoles.</p>

            <p>The non-Chromium version of Edge was initially built using Microsoft's own proprietary browser engine, <strong>EdgeHTML</strong> and their <strong>Chakra JavaScript engine</strong> (a version referred to as <strong>Microsoft Edge Legacy</strong>). It was announced on <strong>January 15, 2020</strong> that a new Chromium-based version of Edge would replace the non-Chromium version. In <strong>June 2020</strong>, Microsoft began to rollout the new version of Edge for during an update for Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 versions. The current version of Edge now uses the same Chromium-based <strong>Blink</strong> rendering engine and <strong>V8 JavaScript engine</strong> as found in Google Chrome.</p>

            <p><strong>EdgeHTML</strong> was the proprietary layout engine originally developed for Edge. It was a fork of the <strong>Trident</strong> engine but with the legacy Internet Explorer (IE) code removed and rewritten to support modern web standards. EdgeHTML was written in C++</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>March 9, 2021</strong> - Microsoft to drop support for existing legacy versions of Edge (non-Chromium). After this date, the legacy version of Edge will no longer receive security updates. Migration of the current Edge (Chromium) advised.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Microsoft has been moving existing Windows 10 users over to the new Chromium-based Edge with Windows updates.</p>

            <h2>Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE)</h2>

            <p>Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) is a web browser developed by Microsoft and released in 1995. It has since been replaced by Edge as the default web browser for Microsoft Windows.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Released:</strong> August 16, 1995</li>
                <li><strong>Rendering Engine:</strong> Trident</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>August 17, 2021</strong> - Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) will no longer be supported by Microsoft for online services like Office 365, OneDrive and Outlook.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Microsoft is expected to drop support for Internet Explorer 11 within Windows 10.</p>

            <p>The Chromium-based version of Microsoft Edge will continue to let businesses access websites, applications and tools built for Internet Explorer using the <strong>Internet Explorer legacy mode</strong> ("IE Mode"). This mode uses the IE rendering engine allowing IE to be built directly into Edge for this purpose. A small 'IE logo' will appear inside the address bar when the mode is active.</p>
