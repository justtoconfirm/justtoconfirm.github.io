			<h1>Google Optimize</h1>

            <p>Google Optimize allows you to test variants of a web page and see how it performs.</p>

            <p><a href="https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/6197440?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Google Optimize documentation</a></p>

            <p>On the free version of the Google Optimize, only five tests can be created at any one time.</p>

            <h2>A/B tests</h2>

            <p>An <strong>A/B test</strong>, sometimes also called an <strong>A/B/n</strong> test, is an experiment using two or more variants of the same web page (A and B). <strong>Variant A</strong> is the original, <strong>Variant B</strong> (through n) each contain at least one element that is modified from the original.</p>

            <p>An example of an A/B test maybe to set a different colour of a CTA (call-to-action) button to see if this drives conversions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>An A/B test example of a product page, Variant A has a blue photo, Variant B has a red photo.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Redirect tests</h2>

            <p>A <strong>redirect test</strong>, also called a <strong>split URL test</strong>, is a type of A/B test that allows you to test separate web pages against each other. In a redirect test, variants are identified by a URL or path instead of by element(s) on the page.</p>

            <p>This type of test is useful when you want to test two very different landing pages, or a redesign of a page.</p>

            <p>An example maybe to test two different landing pages, with different URLs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Original</strong> - www.example.com/landing1</li>
                <li><strong>Variant</strong> - www.example.com/landing2</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Multivariate tests (MVT)</h2>

            <p>A multivariate test (MVT) tests variants of two or more elements simultaneously to see which combination creates the best outcome.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <p>You will need a Google account, such as an Gmail account, to login to Google Optimize</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Log into Optimize</li>
                <li>Click on the <strong>Let's go</strong> button under the <strong>Create your first experience</strong> section</li>
                <li>Add a name for your experience</li>
                <li>Add a URL of the page you'd like to use for the test.</li>
                <li>Set the type of experience, for example, <strong>A/B test</strong>.</li>
                <li>Click the <strong>Create</strong> button.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You will need to setup the Google Optimize code snippet and add it to the &lt;head&gt; section of your page or use Google Tag Manager (GTM) to inject it into the page within a tag.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;script src="https://www.googleoptimize.com/optimize.js?id=OPT_CONTAINER_ID"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>The container ID is part of your Optimize snippet and can be found within the container setup. As of the start of 2020, all IDs begin with <strong>OPT-</strong>.</p>

            <p>Within the Google Optimize dashboard, you will have an Original variant (this is the control and is the current website), and you can then create a new variant (which we will call Variant 1 for simplicity), that will be our test. Once you've completed the setup of your test you can then edit the weight of each variant as this is set to <strong>50%</strong> of traffic for each and preview/edit the variant as required.</p>

            <p>You will need to setup Google Analytics and link to your GA account to connect this to the Google Optimize test being created.</p>

            <h2>Edit the test variant code</h2>

            <p>Once you've setup the test variant, you can then edit the code on the page to set how you want the test to appear.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Click on a specific element and the <strong>Edit element</strong> button to edit the text, HTML, or run JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Or, click the &lt;&gt; code button in the top-right corner of the dashboard to edit the CSS or the page and/or edit the global JavaScript of the page.</li>
                <li>Remember to click <strong>Save</strong> after your code changes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the dashboard, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to do this.</p>

            <h2>Variant Test</h2>

            <p>Below we are testing Google Optimize by displaying control or you will see a change if the variant is showing within the A/B test:</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3 class="box__heading">This is the control</h3>

                <p>This is an element designed to test if the Google Optimize test is running.</p>
            </div>
