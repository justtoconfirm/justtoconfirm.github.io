			<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>

            <p>Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. In an object, variables become known as <strong>properties</strong> and functions are known as <strong>methods</strong>. Properties tell us about the object, methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.</p>

            <p>Properties and methods have a name and a value. Within an object, the name is a <strong>key</strong>. Each key and value is separated by a comma and an object cannot have two keys with the same name. The value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or another object. The value of a method is always a function.</p>

            <h2>Creating Objects: Literal Notation</h2>

            <p><strong>Literal notation</strong> is the easiest and most popular way to create objects in JavaScript. To create an empty <strong>object literal</strong>, use:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var obj = {};
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>The object is stored in a variable. In the example above, the object is stored in a variable called <strong>obj</strong>, so we would refer to it as the <strong>obj object</strong>.</p>

            <p>This object represents a hotel. It has five properties and one method.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var hotel = {
    name: 'Quay',
    rooms: 40,
    booked: 25,
    gym: true,
    roomType: ['twin', 'double', 'suite'],

    checkAvailability: function() {
        return this.rooms - this.booked;
    }
};
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>The hotel object has a method named <strong>checkAvailability()</strong>. The <strong>this</strong> keyword is used to indicate that the method is using the rooms and booked properties of this object.</p>

            <p>The <strong>function</strong> keyword can also be omitted when assigning methods to an object.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
checkAvailability() {
    return this.rooms - this.booked;
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Creating Objects: Constructor Notation</h2>

            <p>The <strong>new</strong> keyword and object constructor can be used to create a new empty object. Properties and methods can then be added to the object. The <strong>Object() constructor</strong> is a function that's part of the JavaScript language and is used to create objects. Once an object has been created, dot notation can be used to add the properties and methods.</p>

            <p>To create an empty object using the <strong>Object()</strong> constructor function:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var obj = new Object();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Here we can use the Constructor Notation to create a hotel object and add properties and methods.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
// Create a new blank hotel object
var hotel = new Object();

// Add properties to this object
hotel.name = 'Quay';
hotel.rooms = 40;
hotel.booked = 25;

// Add method to this object
hotel.checkAvailability = function() {
    return this.rooms - this.booked;
};
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Sometimes you may need many objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. Here we are using a function to create a template with the object's methods and properties.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function Hotel(name, rooms, booked) {
    
    this.name = name;
    this.rooms = rooms;
    this.booked = booked;

    this.checkAvailability = function() {
        return this.rooms - this.booked;
    };

};
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Here a function called Hotel will be used as a template for creating new objects that represent hotels. Like all functions, it contains statements. In this case, the statements add properties and methods to the object. This function has three parameters, each sets the value of a property in the object. The methods will be the same for each object created using this function template.</p>

            <p>The name of the function usually begins with an uppercase letter to help remind developers to use the <strong>new</strong> keyword when they create an object using this template function.</p>

            <p>The <strong>this</strong> keyword is used instead of the object name to indicate that the property or method belongs to the object that this function creates.</p>

            <h3>Instances of the Template</h3>

            <p>You can create instances of the object using a constructor function. The <strong>new</strong> keyword followed by a call to the function, creates a new object using the template. The properties for each object you create are given as arguments to be passed into the function parameters.</p>

            <p>Here two objects are created to represent two hotels. Each object needs a different name. When the <strong>new</strong> keyword calls the constructor function, it creates a new object. Each time it's called, the arguments passed into the function are different because they are properties of two different hotels. Both objects automatically get the same method defined within the function - the <strong>checkAvailability()</strong> method.</p> 

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var quayHotel = new Hotel('Quay', 40, 25);
var parkHotel = new Hotel('Park', 120, 77);
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Even when many objects are created using the same constructor function, the methods stay the same because they access, update, or perform a calculation based on the data stored in the properties.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
quayHotel.checkAvailability();  
parkHotel.checkAvailability();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>This technique maybe used if your script contains a complex object that needs to be available but might not be used. The object is defined in the function, but only created if it's needed.</p>

            <h2>Accessing an Object</h2>

            <p>You can access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. Square brackets can also be used. To access a property or method of an object, use the name of the object followed by a period - the <strong>member operator</strong> - then the name of the property or method you want to access.</p>

            <p>Here we declare two variables to hold the name of the hotel and the number of vacant/available rooms.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var hotelName = hotel.name;
var roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Properties can also be accessed using square brackets. Methods cannot be accessed using this. This time the object name is followed by square brackets and the property name is inside.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var hotelName = hotel['name'];
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Updating an Object</h2>

            <p>To update the value of a property inside an object, use dot notation once again but assing a new value using the <strong>assignment operator</strong> (<strong>=</strong>). Here the name of the hotel is updated to Park.</p>

            <p>If the property you are attempting to update does not exist, it will be added as a new property to the object.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
hotel.name = 'Park';
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>To delete a property from an object, use the <strong>delete</strong> keyword followed by the object name and name of the property.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
delete hotel.name;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>If you want to clear a value of a property, set the value to be a blank string.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
hotel.name = '';
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>
