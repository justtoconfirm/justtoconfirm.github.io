			<h1>Cookies</h1>

            <p>Cookies are small text files stored on a computer used to store information in web pages. When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request. It allows the website to recognise a user's device and store some information about the user's preferences or past actions.</p>

            <p>The <strong>cookie</strong> property of the <strong>Document</strong> object lets you read and write cookies.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You must tell people if you set cookies and clearly explain what the cookies do and why.</li>
                <li>You must get the person's consent to store cookies on their device.</li>
                <li>There is an exception for cookies that are essential to provide an online service at someone's request, such as to remember items in an online basket or to ensure security in online banking.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As long as you do this the first time you set cookies, you do not have to repeat it each time the same person visits the website. The device however maybe used by different people, so you may want to consider repeating the process at suitable intervals (perhaps set an expiry date for the cookie).</p>

            <p><strong>PECR (The Privacy and Electronic Commincations Regulations)</strong> sits alongside the <strong>Data Protection Act</strong> and <strong>GDPR</strong>.</p>

            <p>The <strong>ICO</strong> (<strong>Information Commissioner's Office</strong>) have a page dedicated to <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cookies and similar technologies</a> on their website.</p>

            <p>There are two exemptions from PECR which apply:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cookies used to remember goods a user wishes to buy when they add goods to their online basket or proceed to the checkout during online shopping & e-commerce transactions. Cookies used to remember preferences are also excluded.</li>
                <li>Session cookies providing security that is essential to comply with data protection security requirements, such as online banking.</li>
                <li>load-balancing cookies that ensure the content of the page loads quickly and effectively by distributing the workload across multiple servers/machines.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is still good practice to provide users with information about these cookies, even if you do not need consent.</p>

            <p>Cookies applied for Marketing, Analytics or any form of tracking of user behaviour must not be set by default and must be opt-in by the user before they can be applied.</p>

            <h2>Write a new Cookie</h2>

            <p>We can create a cookie using <strong>document.cookie</strong> and set the name and value of this cookie within a string. Cookies are saved in name/value pairs.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
document.cookie = "username=Dan Jackson";      
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>We can also add an expiry date. By default, a cookie is deleted when the browser is closed.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
document.cookie = "username=Dan Jackson; expires=Thu, 31 Dec 2020 12:00:00 GMT";      
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Return all cookies</h2>

            <p>We can use the cookie property to return all cookies in a single string.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
let cookies = document.cookie;     
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>
