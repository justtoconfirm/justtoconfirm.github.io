			<h1>Qubit</h1>

            <p>Qubit is a <strong>CRO (Conversion Rate Optimisation)</strong> tool that uses <strong>Node Package Manager (NPM)</strong> and the <strong>command-line</strong> to make building tests easier for developers.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.qubit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.qubit.com/</a></p>

            <p>Qubit was founded by a small team who previously worked at Google. Based in London's Convent Garden and with offices in both London and Los Angeles.</p>

            <p><strong>Conversion Rate Optimisation</strong>, or <strong>CRO</strong>, is the practice of raising your conversion rate by compelling visitors to your site to take specific actions. It is used to make small, incrememntal improvements, often through the use of CRO tools, to write CRO tests to test the effect of any changes on visitors. These tests are often referred to as A/B or MVT tests. Tools such as <strong>Qubit</strong>, <strong>Google Optimize</strong>, <strong>VWO</strong>, <strong>Adobe Target</strong>, and <strong>Monetate</strong> are just some of the tools used for CRO.</p>

            <h2>Developers</h2>

            <p>Qubit has a <a href="https://medium.com/qubit-personalization/integrate-qubit-with-your-continuous-integration-process-4a8904f8130f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> which lets developers work inside their own repositories (repos) and push changes ot experiences up to Qubit. <strong>NPM packages</strong> are also available allowing code reuse.</p>

            <p>The Qubit CLI also provides support inside a CI/CD environment.</p>

            <p>The code can be pulled down to your local machine and checked into your main codebase. Development can take place in your code editor of choice and run locally using the Qubit hot-reloading build system and <strong>Chrome extension</strong>.</p>

            <p>Qubit uses <strong>CommonJS modules</strong> so they can be managed like other NPM packages. You can also develop <strong>unit tests</strong> against these modules using a framework of choice. Qubit use <strong>Jest</strong>.</p>

            <p>Support for both <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong> is also provided.</p>

            <h2>A/B testing</h2>

            <p>On a simple level, A/B testing is a method of experimenting with two versions of a website or mobile app. By observing and comparing the behavior of visitors randomly allocated to each version, we can determine which performed better against defined goals such as conversion rate or click-through rate.</p>

            <p>Qubit uses A/B testing as a framework to compare two versions of a website or mobile app. Visitors are randomly bucketed into one of the two versions - control or variation - and behaviors are observed over time.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control</strong> - visitors see your website or mobile app without any changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Variant</strong> - visitors will see the changes you're testing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A/B testing allows you to determine what impact your personalisation is having in your site. Usually there's a control (A) and a variant (B), with randomised allocation of visitors for each group based on traffic allocation.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Optimise key landing page performance</strong> - use templates to quickly alter key messages on select pages to improve performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Command-line interface</strong> - allowing developers to build experiences and includes native integration with the Node Package Manager (NPM). Qubit also has server-side capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Test targeted segments</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Surveys</strong> - test experiences and use surveys to gather first-hand feedback from visitors. <strong>Qubit Visitor Pulse</strong> can be used to collect <strong>Net Promoter Scores (NPS)</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Personalisation</h2>

            <p>Website personalisation can be used to improve the customer experience and ensure the experience is relevant to your visitors.</p>
