            <p>The <strong>Context API</strong> of React is a state management tool that can often be used in-place of <a href="redux.html">Redux</a> altogether. This replaces the need to use the central store in Redux using a native React API.</p>

            <p>The Context APU was released in <strong>React v16.3.0</strong>.</p>

            <p>Context API provides a way of passing data through the components without having the pass props down through every level.</p>

            <p>In React applications, we need to pass state from the top level of the application through components, using props, to the one which needs the data, even if not all components needed the data. This is known as <strong>prop drilling</strong>. The Context API helps us to avoid this.</p>

            <p>The Context API is ideal for a time when you want to share data globally with your components, such as auth data, theme or language.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context</strong> - allows you to share information with any component by storing it in a central place and allowing access to any component that requests it (usually you're only able to pass data from parent to child via props).</li>
                <li><strong>Provider</strong> - acts as a delivery service.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Setting up Context API</h2>

            <p>As of React v16.8, <a href="react-hooks.html">Hooks</a> have allowed the implementation of a number of React features in components, such as state, without having to write a class. This includes better code reuse and sharing od state between components. We will be using the following React hooks:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>useState</li>
                <li>useReducer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The <strong>useState</strong> hook is recommended for handling simple values like numbers or strings, handling complex data structures is better handled by the <strong>useReducer</strong> hook.</p>

            <p>Once you declare the state using either hook, we will need to lift it up to become global state using the Context API. This is done by creating a <strong>Context Object</strong> using the <strong>createContext()</strong> method provided by React. A Context Object allows state to be shared among components without using props and avoiding prop drilling.</p>

            <p>We will also need to declare a <strong>Context Provider</strong> for our Context Object to allow a page or component to subscribe (use) your Context Object for changes. The <strong>useContext()</strong> method is needed for this.</p>

            <p>To summarise:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context Object</strong> - use the createContext() method to create an object that allows global state to be shared</li>
                <li><strong>Context Provider</strong> - allows components to use/connect to the Context Object to get the global state</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Counter Example</h2>

            <p>For this example, we will build a simple counter. The count state will be shared globally among two components, both will be a child of <strong>CounterView</strong>, which will act as a container.</p>

            <p>Let's start by defining our count state in a context file called <strong>context/counter-context.js</strong> within the <strong>src</strong> directory of your React application.</p>

            <p>We will be using the <strong>useState</strong> hook and <strong>createContext()</strong> method from React.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React, { useState, createContext } from 'react'

// Create the Context Object
export const CounterContext = createContext()

// Create a provider for components to consume and subscribe to changes
export const CounterContextProvider = props => {
    const [ count, setCount ] = useState(0)

    return (
        &lt;CounterContext.Provider value={[ count, setCount ]}&gt;
            {props.children}
        &lt;/CounterContext.Provider&gt;
    )
}   
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Here we've defined a state called <strong>count</strong> with a default value of <strong>0</strong>. All components that consume the <strong>CounterContext.Provider</strong> will have access to the count state and the setCount function.</p>

            <p>We can now create a component for displaying the count state. Create an empty JavaScript file in the <strong>src</strong> directory with the directory and file name of <strong>/components/counter/Display.js</strong> and add the following code:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { CounterContext } from '../context/counter-context'

const CounterDisplay = () => {
    const [ count ] = useContext(CounterContext)

    return (
        &lt;p&gt;{count}&lt;/p&gt;
    )
}

export default CounterDisplay 
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Next, define the components that will contain buttons for increasing and decreasing the count. Create the file <strong>/components/counter/Buttons.js</strong> and insert the following code:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { CounterContext } from '../context/counter-context'

const CounterButtons = () => {
    const [ count, setCount ] = useContext(CounterContext)

    const increment = () => {
        setCount(count + 1)
    }

    const decrement = () => {
        setCount(count - 1)
    }

    return (
        &lt;&gt;
            &lt;button onClick={increment}&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;button onClick={decrement}&gt;Minus&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/&gt;
    )
}

export default CounterButtons
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>As it is, the useContext() method won't work since the <strong>Provider</strong> hasn't been specified. To specify the provider, create an empty file as a container with the filename <strong>/components/counter/Counter.js</strong> and insert the following code:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React from 'react'
import { CounterContextProvider } from '../context/counter-context'
import Display from '../components/counter/Display'
import Buttons from '../components/counter/Buttons'

const Counter = () => {
    return (
        &lt;&gt;
            &lt;CounterContextProvider&gt;
                &lt;Display /&gt;
                &lt;Buttons /&gt;
            &lt;/CounterContextProvider&gt;
        &lt;/&gt;
    )
}

export default Counter
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Finally, update your <strong>App.js</strong> component inside your React application to render the Counter.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import Counter from './components/counter/Counter'

const App = () => {
    return &lt;Counter /&gt;
}

render(
    &lt;App /&gt;,
    document.getElementById('root')
)
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Your application file structure should look something like this:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
src /
    components /
        counter /
            Buttons.js
            Counter.js
            Display.js
    context /
        counter-context.js
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>
