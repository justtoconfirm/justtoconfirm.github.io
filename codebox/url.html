            <p>A <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>, is a mechanism used by the browser to retrieve any published resource on the web. It is nothing more than the address given to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, CSS stylesheet, an image or anything else that maybe published.</p>

            <h2>Scheme</h2>

            <p>The first part of the URL is the <strong>scheme</strong>, which indicates the protocol that the browser must use to request the resource. Usually for websites the protocol is <strong>HTTPS</strong> or <strong>HTTP</strong> (its unsecured version). The browser can handle other schemes such as <strong>mailto:</strong> (to open a mail client) or <strong>ftp:</strong> (to handle file transfers).</p>

<pre>
    <code>

https:
http:
mailto:
ftp:
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Authority</h2>

            <p>The authority follows the scheme, which is separated by the character pattern <strong>://</strong> and includes the domain name, but can also include the port number (separated by a colon).</p>

            <p>The <strong>domain name</strong> indicated which web server is being requested. Usually the domain name is used, but an IP address may also be used.</p>

            <p>The <strong>port</strong> indicates the technical "gate" used to access the resources on the web server. It is usually omitted if the web server uses the standard ports of the HTTP protocol (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) to grant access to the resources.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
://www.example.com
://www.example.com:80
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>The <strong>mailto:</strong> scheme does not use an authority for the mail client, therefore the colon is not followed by two slashes and only acts as a delimiter between the scheme and the mail address.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
mailto:contactme@mydomain.com
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Path to resource</h2>

            <p>The <strong>path to resource</strong> is a path that represents the physical location of a file on a web server.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
/path/to/myfile.html
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Anchor</h2>

            <p>An anchor represents a sort of "bookmark" inside the resource giving the browser the directions to show the content located at that "bookemarked" spot. Within an HTML document, the browser will scroll to the point where the anchor is defined. The hash (<strong>#</strong>) is also known as the <strong>fragment identifier</strong> and is never sent to the server with the request.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
https://www.example.com/path/to/myfile.html#anAnchor
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>URL Parameters</h2>

            <p><strong>URL parameters</strong>, also known as <strong>"query strings"</strong> or <strong>"URL query parameters"</strong>, are elements that are inserted into your URLs to help you filter and organise content, or track information on your site.</p>

            <p>URL parameters are a way to pass information about a click using the URL itself and can be used to pass data from page to page within a URL.</p>

            <p>If your website has many paramater-based URLs, it's important to signal to the web crawlers which pages not to index and to link to the static, non-parameterised page when considering SEO. A static page URL would look something like this:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
https://www.domain.com/shoes
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Once you've decided on which static page should be indexed, remember to canonicalize it. Set up canonical tags on the parameterised URLs referencing the preferred URL. This will send a signal to crawlers that only the main landing page is to be indexed and not the parameterised URLs.</p>

            <p>You'll notice that on this page, the URL of <strong>page=url</strong> is passed into the URL as a parameter with a value when you click on the link to open this page.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;a href="url.html?page=url"&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>The URL parameter refers to the portion of the URL that comes after a question mark (<strong>?</strong>) and are made of a key and a value, separated by an equal sign (<strong>=</strong>). Multiple parameters are each then separated by an ampersand (<strong>&</strong>).</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
https://www.domain.com/page?key1=value1&key2=value2
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>URL parameters are commonly used to sort content on a page, making it easier for users to navigate products in an online store. These query strings allow users to order a page according to specific filters and to view a set amount of items per page.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
// Main page
https://www.onlinestore.com/shoes

// URL parameters
https://www.onlinestore.com/shoes?rank=newest
https://www.onlinestore.com/shoes?sessionid=niketrainers
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>There are two types of URL parameters:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content-modifying parameters</strong> (active) - parameters that will modify the content displayed on the page, for example to send a user directly to a specific product.</li>
                <li><strong>Tracking parameters</strong> (passive) - used for advanced tracking, parameters that will pass information about a click, for example which network it came from and/or campaign - this won't change the content on the page.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here's an example of a <strong>content-modifying parameter</strong> to send a user directly to a specific product called 'xyz':</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
https://www.domain.com?productid=xyz
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Here's an example of a <strong>tracking parameter</strong> used to track traffic from your newsletter:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
https://www.domain.com?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>Or, to collect campaign data with custom URLs:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
https://www.domain.com?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=tweet&utm_campaign=summer-sale
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h3>URL Parameter Examples</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tracking</strong> - UTM codes used for tracking traffic from ads and campaigns</li>
                <li><strong>Reordering</strong> - Ordering items according to specific parameters</li>
                <li><strong>Searching</strong> - To find results using a site's internal search engine</li>
                <li><strong>Identifying</strong> - Sorting pages, such as image gallery, by size, category etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Paginating</strong> - Segment content on pages</li>
                <li><strong>Translating</strong> - Adding the language name to the end of a URL string</li>
                <li><strong>Filtering</strong> - Filter distinct fields</li>

            <h2>Absolute URLs</h2>

            <p>In your browser's address bar, a URL doesn't have any context, so you must provide a full (or absolute) URL. You don't need to include the protocol (the browser uses HTTP by default) or port (which is only required when the targeted web server is using an unusual port), but all other parts of the URL are necessary.</p>

            <p>When a URL is used within a document, such as in an HTML page, the browser already has the document's own URL, so it can use this information to fill in the missing parts of any URL available inside that document.</p>

            <p>If a URL starts with "/", the browser will fetch that resource from the top root of the server.</p>

            <p>This is a full absolute URL:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
https://www.domain.com/en-GB/docs
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p><strong>Implicit protocol</strong> - in this case, the browser will call that URL with the same protocol (https:) as the one used to load the document hosting that URL:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
//www.domain.com/en-GB/docs
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>
