			<h1>Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</h1>

            <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are web applications that are regular web pages or websites but can appear to the user like traditional applications or native mobile apps. PWAs attempt to combine features offered by most modern browsers with the benefits of a mobile experience.</p>

            <p>PWA is not one web technology, but a collection of web technologies including the web app manifest.</p>

            <p>Unlike regular web apps with simple homescreen links or bookmarks, PWAs can be downloaded in advance, ise regular Web APIs (Application Program Interfaces) and can work offline.</p>

            <p>Progressive Web Apps are built and enhanced with modern APIs to deliver native-like capabilities, reliability, and installability while reaching anyone, anywhere, and on any device with a single codebase.</p>

            <h2>Add a web app manifest</h2>

            <p>The web app manifest is a JSON file that provides information about the web application and tells the browser about how it should behave when installed on the user's desktop or mobile device. The manifest file is necessary for the web app to be downloaded and presented to the user similarly to a native application. This allows the app to be installed on the homescreen of a device, providing users with quick access and a richer experience.</p>

            <p>A typical manifest file includes the app name, icons the app should use, and the URL that should be opened when the app is launched. Manifest files are supported in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and the Samsung mobile browser. Safari has partial support.</p>

            <p>Tha manifest file can have any name, but is commonly named <strong>manifest.webmanifest</strong> and served from the root of your project directory/folder (your website's top-level directory).</p>

            <p>Web app manifests are deployed in your HTML pages using a &lt;link&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; of a document.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest"&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>To verify your manifest is setup correctly, use the <strong>Manifest</strong> pane in the <strong>Application</strong> panel of Chrome DevTools.</p>

            <p>This will allow your application to be downloaded and opened in <strong>Offline mode</strong> when viewed on a mobile device.</p>

            <h2>Meta tags</h2>

            <p>When running a Lighthouse audit, you may need to also add a meta tag into your HTML to set the theme colour.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;meta name="theme-color" content="#e8e6e8"&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Service Workers</h2>

            <p>A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, allowing features to be used that don't need a web page or user interaction.</p>

            <p>To install a service worker for your site, you need to register it, which is done in the JavaScript of your web page. Registering a service worker will cause the browser to start the service worker install step in the background.</p>

            <p>Typically during the install step, you'll want to cache some static assets. If all the files are cached successfully, then the service worker becomes installed. If any of the files fail to download and cache, then the install step will fail and the service worker won't activate (install).</p>

            <p>Service workers are currently supported by Chrome, Firefox and Opera.</p>

            <p>Offline experiences are supported by this API. You will need HTTPS setup on your server. To add HTTPS to your server you'll need to get a TLS certificate and set it up for your server.</p>

            <p>To install a service worker you first need to kick start the process by registering it in your page. This tells the browser where your service worker JavaScript file lives.</p>

            <p>Add the following script to your web page to register a service worker:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
// Register a service worker
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js').then(function(registration) {
      // Registration was successful
      console.log('ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ', registration.scope);
    }, function(err) {
      // registration failed :(
      console.log('ServiceWorker registration failed: ', err);
    });
  });
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Create a service worker file named <strong>sw.js</strong> in the root of your project folder.</p>

            <p>Within the sw.js file, add the following code:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
});
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>In absence of abobe code, your service worker will get registered but web app install banner won't show up. Instead, you will see the following error message in your console: "The page does not work offline".</p>

            <p>This will add an install option on desktop (in the address bar) and a small banner at the bottom of the page to install onto the homescreen on mobile devices.</p>
