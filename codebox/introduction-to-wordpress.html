						<h2>How to setup WordPress</h2>

						<p>WordPress can be downloaded from the <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress.org</a> website. The latest version of WordPress is version 5.8. It is recommended to never edit the core code of WordPress.</p>

						<p>The recommended requirements:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Apache or Nginx web server</li>
							<li>PHP version 7.4 or greater</li>
							<li>MySQL version 5.6 or greater / MariaDB version 10.1 or greater</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Install the web server</h3>

						<p>To setup the Apache or Nginx web server locally, install one of these recommended tools:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/mac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAMP PRO (Mac)</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/windows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAMP PRO (Windows)</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://www.wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WampServer</a></li>

					<p>WordPress houses lots of different types of content that are divided into something called <strong>Post Types</strong>. By default WordPress stores all post types in the database under the <strong>wp_posts</strong> table.</p>

					<section>
						<h2>Posts</h2>

						<p>Posts are entries listed in reverse chronological order on your site. Think of them as articles, or blog posts, that can be displayed on your site.</p>

						<p>A post is an example of a <strong>Post Type</strong> in WordPress. This will be stored in the <strong>wp_posts</strong> table within the database.</p>

						<p>To create your first post, log in to your WordPress dashboard and navigate to <strong>Posts/Add New</strong>.</p>

						<p>When you create a post, you can assign it to a category and add tags, so your visitors can browse content by topic rather than chronologically by date.</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Categories</strong> - are like a table of contents for your WordPress site. For instance, if you sell merchandise, one of your categories maybe "Shirts".</li>
							<li><strong>Tags</strong> - are granular terms that are specific to a piece of content. For instance, if you want to publish an announcement about a new Shirt, you may use tags like "Organic Cotton" or "Sports" as descriptors.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Pages</h2>

						<p>Pages are used for static content that is not affected by date. For example, an About page, Contact page, or Home page, are examples of pages. We may also have a Blog page used to display posts. Pages are typically listed in your site's navigation.</p>

						<p>A page is an example of a <strong>Post Type</strong> in WordPress. This will be stored in the <strong>wp_posts</strong> table within the database.</p>

						<p>To create your first page, log in to your WordPress dashboard and navigate to <strong>Pages/Add New</strong>.</p>

						<p>Pages do not use categories or tags, unlike posts. Instead, pages can be organised into parent and child page groups to group them hierarchically. For instance, you may have a parent page called "Apparel" which can then be split into "Women's Apparal" and "Men's Apparal".</p>

						<h2>Plugins</h2>

						<p>WordPress plugins are PHP scripts that extend the functionality or add new features to WordPress. Any plugin installed will be placed within the <strong>wp-content/plugins/</strong> directory of your WordPress installation.</p>

						<p>It's possible to install plugins manually by extracting and copying them into the plugins directory. Doing so will make them available for activation within the WordPress admin dashboard.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)</h2>

						<p><a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)</a> is a WordPress plugin that allows you to add extra content fields, known as <strong>Custom Fields</strong>, to the edit screens within the admin dashboard of WordPress.</p>

						<p>This plugin does not come pre-installed with WordPress so needs to be installed to be used. The plugin will be installed in the <strong>wp-content/plugins/</strong> directory of your WordPress installation.</p>

						<p>Once installed, we will see a <strong>Custom Fields</strong> tab in the sidebar of the WordPress admin dashboard.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Themes</h2>

						<p>WordPress sites can be styled using themes. We have the option to install an existing theme or we can choose to create our own custom theme. A list of available themes available to install can be found on the <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress.org website</a>.</p>

						<p>Any theme installed will be inside the <strong>wp-content/themes/</strong> directory of your WordPress installation. WordPress 5.8 comes pre-installed with the <strong>Twenty Twenty-One</strong> theme by default. This theme can be changed.</p>

						<p>A WordPress theme needs two files to exist - <strong>style.css</strong> and <strong>index.php</strong>. Some themes will also have a <strong>functions.php</strong> file. This is known as a theme functions file and acts like a plugin for the WordPress site that's automatically activated within the current theme.</p>

						<p>To view the templates from within the WordPress admin dashboard, open the <strong>Appearance/Themes</strong> tab from within the dashboard sidebar.</p>
