			<h1>React State</h1>

            <p>React components have a built-in <strong>state</strong> object where the property values belonging to the component are stored. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.</p>

            <p>Libraries and tools, such as <a href="redux.html">Redux</a>, are available for managing state across your application.</p>

            <p>State allows components to create and manage their own data. Unlike props, components cannot pass data with state.</p>

<pre>
    <code>

import React, { Component } from 'react'        
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

class Test extends Component {                  
    constructor() {
        super()

        this.state = {
            id: 1,
            name: 'test'
        }
    }

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;{this.state.id}&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;{this.state.name}&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
        )
    }
}

</pre>

            <p>Class components were previously used to manage state within a React component. Since React version 16.8.0, <a href="react-hooks.html">React Hooks</a> can now be used to manage state within a component without the need to use a class and constructor.</p>

            <p>We can add as many properties as we like within the state object.</p>

            <p>In this example, a class is written to demonstate using state in React. The <strong>state object</strong> is initialised within the <strong>constructor method</strong>.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React, { Component } from 'react'        // Can be written as: import React from 'react'; 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

class Bulb extends Component {                  // Can then be written as: class Bulb extends React.Component
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        this.state = {
            bulb: 'off'
        }
    }

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;h1&gt;Bulb&lt;/h1&gt;
        )
    }
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Refer to the <strong>state</strong> object anywhere within the component by using the <strong>this.state.propertyname</strong> syntax. Here, we refer to the state object in the <strong>render()</strong> method.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
render() {
    return (
        &lt;h1&gt;Bulb: {this.state.bulb}&lt;/h1&gt;
    )
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>To change a value in the state object, use the <strong>this.setState()</strong> method.</p>

            <p>State should <strong>not</strong> be modified directly, but it can be modified with the <strong>setState()</strong> method.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
this.state.id = '2021'          // incorrect

this.setState({
    id: '2021'                  // correct
})
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Always use the <strong>setState()</strong> method to change the state object, it will ensure that the component knows its been updated and calls the <strong>render()</strong> method (and any other lifecycle method).</p>

            <p>A change in the state happens based on user-input, triggering an event, and so on. React components with state are rendered based on the data in the state. State holds the initial information.</p>

            <p>When the value in the state object changes, the component will <strong>re-render</strong>, meaning the output will change to the new value(s). So, when state changes, React gets informed and immediately re-renders the DOM (Document Object Model) - not the whole DOM, but only the component with the updated state. This is why React is so fast. The <strong>setState()</strong> method triggers the re-rendering process for the updated parts and React knows which part(s) to change without the need to re-render the whole DOM.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React, { Component } from 'react'        // Can be written as: import React from 'react'; 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

class Bulb extends Component {                  // Can then be written as: class Bulb extends React.Component
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        this.state = {
            bulb: 'off'
        }
    }

    // Button to change state onClick
    lightOn = () => {
        this.setState({
            bulb: 'on'
        })
    }

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Bulb: {this.state.bulb}&lt;/h1&gt;

                &lt;button type="button" onClick={this.lightOn}&gt;Light on&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
        )
    }
}

            <h2>Differences between props & state</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Components receive data from outside with props, whereas they can create and manage their own data with state.</li>
                <li>Props are used to pass data, state is for managing data.</li>
                <li>Data from props is read-only and cannot be modified by a component.</li>
                <li>State data can be modified by its own component, but is private and cannot be accessed from outside.</li>
                <li>Props can only be passed from a parent component to child component (unidirectional flow).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Introducing Hooks</h2>

            <p>We can now manage state within a component using <a href="react-hooks.html">Hooks</a> and writing our components as functions instead of classes.</p>

            <p>Hooks are a new addition to React 16.8 and let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks <strong>don't</strong> work inside classes, but you can use them instead of writing classes.</p>

            <p>If your project is not using React Hooks, then you can only use state in class components.</p>

            <p>A Hook is a special function that lets you "hook into" React features. For example, <strong>useState</strong> is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.</p>

            <p>Let's start by writing a counter using class component.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

class Counter extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        this.state = {
            count: 0
        }
    }

    setCount = () => {
        this.setState({
            count: this.state.count + 1
        })
    }

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You clicked {this.state.count} times&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;button type="button" onClick={this.setCount}&gt;Add to Count&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
        )
    }
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>We can remove the need for a function and update the state from within the button itself.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

class Counter extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        this.state = {
            count: 0
        }
    }

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You clicked {this.state.count} times&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;button type="button" onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}&gt;Add to Count&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
        )
    }
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>This example can now be re-written to use the state hook and replace the class with a function.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

    return (
        &lt;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;button type="button" onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Add to Count&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/&gt;
    )
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>As a reminder, function components in React look like this:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
const Example = props => {
    // You can use Hooks here!
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Or can be written like this:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function Example(props) {
    // You can use Hooks here!
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Components written using functions were previously known as <strong>stateless components</strong>, the preferred name for this type of function is <strong>function components</strong>.</p>
