			<h1>Design Systems</h1>
            <!-- https://www.aiimi.com/insights/guide-to-pattern-libraries-the-key-to-design-consistency#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20pattern%20library,solutions%20that%20solve%20design%20problems. -->

            <p>A Design System is an ever-evolving set of design guidelines and reusable elements. Design Systems contain both Style Guides and Pattern Libraries.</p>

            <p>Here is <a href="https://atlassian.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlassian's Design System</a>.</p>

            <p>And here is an blog post on how <a href="https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AirBnB created their visual design language</a>.</p>

            <p>The aim of a Design System is to provide a toolbox of "ready-to-go" UI components that can be used for any given application. Instead of seeing a web page as one solid object, you should see it as many independent parts, or components (like Lego bricks).</p>

            <h2>Style Guide</h2>

            <p>A Style Guide is a rulebook that explains how a brand presents itself and should be used as a reference document to help maintain consistency to set out your brand guidelines.</p>

            <p>It is a document that contains design guidelines and outlines the visual identity and set the guidelines for your brand. The styleguide usually includes things like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Typography (Font/Typeface)</li>
                <li>Icons</li>
                <li>Imagery
                <li>Colours - the colour palette used</li>
                <li>UI Elements - Logos, Buttons & Headings</li>
                <li>Tone of Voice (ToV)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The style guide is often developed after the high-fidelity wireframes have been created so that you can see what element are needed.</p>

            <p>This guide is a living, breathing document and you must plan for the evolution of your brand.</p>

            <p>A <strong>Living/Live Style Guide</strong> is similar to a normal static Style Guide in the sense that it also sets a group of rules and guidelines for the brand, but it has the advantage of including code elements that can help the development team to focus on building the application without having to code first.</p>

            <h2>Pattern Libraries</h2>

            <p>A Pattern Library is a library of User Interface (UI) patterns that designers and design teams use to build digital products. This most often takes the form of a document in a tool such as Sketch, containing a wide range of different patterns organised into specific groups - from smaller components such as Buttons, Labels and Icons, through to larger, more complex components such as Navigation and Headers.</p>

            <p>Similar to Lego, designers are able to choose which pieces they need, then snap them together to build a range of different UI elements/components. This approach of building larger components from smaller ones is often referred to as <strong>Atomic Design</strong>.</p>

            <p>A tool like <a href="https://zeplin.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeplin</a> can be used to create a Pattern Library/Styleguide within the Design System. Zeplin will also generate code to assist developers. Zeplin is a plugin that takes designs from <strong>Sketch</strong>, <strong>Adobe XD</strong>, <strong>Figma</strong>, or <strong>Adobe Photoshop CC</strong> and exports them into a format which generates code snippets, design specs and assets. It's defined as a collaboration tool for UI designers and developers.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma</a> is a vector graphics editor and prototyping browser-based tool for UI and UX design.</p>

            <h2>Component Library</h2>

            <p>A Component Library is a set of re-usable components available to developers that can be used across multiple projects and/or applications. These components serve as the building blocks for layouts, and thanks to their modular nature, we can arrange components in many ways to achieve different effects.</p>

            <p>Here is <a href="https://atlassian.design/components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlassian's Component Library</a>.</p>

            <p>Examples of re-usable components include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Buttons</li>
                <li>Inputs</li>
                <li>Modals</li>
            </ul>

            <p><a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Storybook</a> can be used as an open-source tool to compliment a Component Library. This is a tool for developing UI components and pages in isolation and simplifies building, documenting and testing UIs.</p>
