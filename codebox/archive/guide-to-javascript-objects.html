		<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>

		<p>Objects in JavaScript are used to group together variables and functions to act as a container for data values. The values are written as <strong>name:value</strong> pairs. The <strong>name:value</strong> pairs in a JavaScript object are called <strong>properties</strong>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>A <strong>variable</strong> is referred to as a <strong>property</strong> when in an object.</li>
			<li>A <strong>function</strong> is referred to as a <strong>method</strong> when in an object.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It is common practice to <strong>declare</strong> (create) an object using the <strong>const</strong> keyword. Here we are creating an empty object called <strong>hotel</strong>. This is known as an <strong>object literal</strong> (also known as <strong>literal notation</strong>). This is often the easiest way to create objects in JavaScript.</p>

		<pre>
			<code>
const hotel = {}
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>We can now add <strong>properties</strong> to this object. Properties tell us about the object. All hotel objects will have the same properties, but the property values will differ from hotel to hotel.</p>

		<pre>
			<code>
const hotel = {
	name: "Quay",
	rooms: 150,
	booked: 90,
	gym: true,
	pool: true,
	roomType: ["Twin", "Double", "Suite"]
}
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>We can output the values of the properties within the object using <strong>dot notation</strong> like so:</p>

		<pre>
			<code>
objectName.propertyName
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>As an example, we can use dot notation to output the name of the hotel.</p>

		<pre>
			<code>
hotel.name
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>Our hotel object can be updated to add a method to display the number of rooms available in the hotel.</p>

		<pre>
			<code>
const hotel = {
	name: "Quay",
	rooms: 150,
	booked: 90,
	gym: true,
	pool: true,
	roomType: ["Twin", "Double", "Suite"],

	checkRoomAvailability() {
		return this.rooms - this.booked;
	}
}
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>To call the method, refence the object and then the name of the method itself.</p>

		<pre>
			<code>
hotel.checkRoomAvailability()
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>The <strong>this</strong> keyword is used to indicate that the <strong>rooms</strong> and <strong>booked</strong> properties of this object are being used.</p>
