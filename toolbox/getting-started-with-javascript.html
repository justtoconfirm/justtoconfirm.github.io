        	<h1>Getting Started with JavaScript</h1>

            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification and was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. JavaScript files typically have the file extension of .js</p> 

            <p>JavaScript is synchronous meaning the code will run line after line and is single-threaded meaning only one command will be executed at any given time. The language is a high-level programming language because the syntax is closer to human languages and further from machine language.</p>

            <h2>What is ECMAScript &amp; LiveScript?</h2>

            <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. Netscape initially labeled this new language as LiveScript before renaming it to JavaScript a year later. This was to capitalise on the popularity of the Java programming language at the time - both JavaScript and Java are unrelated - In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for standardisation. This eventually led to the language standard being referred to as ECMAScript.</p>

            <p>All major implementations of JavaScript have since been known as ECMAScript, however the term JavaScript has stuck around for historic and marketing reasons.</p>

            <h2>What is a Compiler?</h2>

            <p>A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another language. The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language, such as JavaScript, to a lower lever language to be executed.</p>

            <p>A Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is used to convert JavaScript code into machine code. Typically, when JavaScript code is entered into the console within a browser's developer tools (DevTools), the code is passed to the JIT compiler, compiled, executed and the output is returned back to the console.</p>

            <p>The V8 JavaScript engine in Chrome is a compiler. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code at execution by implementing a JIT compiler. This is similar to many other JavaScript engines such as SpiderMonkey or Rhino (Mozilla). The V8 engine used by Chrome is open source and written in C++</p>

            <h2>JavaScript runs where it is found in the HTML</h2>

            <p>When the browser comes across a &lt;script&gt; element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything else.</p>

            <p>When you place your JavaScript links at the bottom of your HTML page before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag, it gives the HTML time to load before any JavaScript code is executed. This prevents errors and improves the speed in which the page renders.</p>

            <h2>Adding a script file to your HTML</h2>

            <p>Once you've written a HTML document, the time may come to add a JavaScript script file. This should ideally be placed before the closing HTML &lt;/body&gt; tag, although there are certain exceptions to this rule. In this example, the example script file named script.js is being added to our HTML.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>In HTML5, when adding a script to HTML, the type attribute is no-longer needed but you may still come across examples like this that are still considered valid:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>
