	<h1>Getting Started with React</h1>

	<h2>What is React?</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>React is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook.</li>
		<li>Used to build front end user interfaces (UI).</li>
		<li>React is the view layer of an MVC (Model View Controller) application.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>React allows components to be created, which are similar to reusable HTML elements, to quickly build user interfaces. Data within React is stored and handled using state and props.</p> 

	<h2>React Developer Tools</h2>

	<p>There is a browser extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Developer Tools</a> that will make working with React much easier. Download React DevTools for Chrome, or for the browser you prefer to use.</p>

	<p>Once installed, when you open DevTools, you'll see a tab for React. This will allow you to inspect components as they're written. You can still go to the Elements tab to see the actual DOM (Document Object Model) output.</p>

	<h2>Install React</h2>

	<p>Node Package Manager (NPM) can be used to install React. Begin by creating a new directory where the React application will be built and setup a package.json file. Open your terminal and run the following commands:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
$ mkdir react-application
$ cd react-application

$ npm init -y
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We now want to install the following packages:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>react - the top-level <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> of the React library.</li>
    	<li>react-dom - <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> specific methods used by React.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>React and ReactDOM were split into two packages from version 0.14. ReactDOM is where you will find the render method.</p>

    <p>Once again, run the following commands in your terminal to install react and react-dom as dependencies:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
$ npm install react react-dom --save
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>At this stage you may need to setup <a href="getting-started-with-webpack.html">Webpack</a> and <a href="getting-started-with-babel.html">Babel</a> to get React working.</p>
