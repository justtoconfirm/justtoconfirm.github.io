            <h1>Images</h1>

            <p>Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page. In HTML, images are defined with the &lt;img&gt; tag. The tag itself is empty and contains attributes only without a closing tag.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="An example alt text"&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>The Alt attribute</h2>

            <p>The Alt attribute - also called an "alt tag" - is the written copy that appears in place of an image if it fails to load on a user's screen. This text helps screen-reading tools to describe images to visually impaired users and allows search engines to better crawl and rank the page content as a consideration of SEO (Search Engine Optimisation).</p>

            <p>The example, below, shows an example image with an alt attribute but this is considered as being "okay" as it's not very descriptive. More detail can be said about the image.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;img src="pancakes.jpg" alt="Pancakes"&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>This example is much better as it's far more descriptive.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;img src="pancakes.jpg" alt="Stack of pancakes with maple syrup"&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>  

            <p>Further examples may include:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;!-- Okay text --&gt;
&lt;img src="escalator.jpg" alt="Man on escalator"&gt;

&lt;!-- Good text --&gt;
&lt;img src="escalator.jpg" alt="Man walking on an escalator"&gt;

&lt;!-- Recommended text --&gt;
&lt;img src="escalator.jpg" alt="Man wearing a backpack walking down an escalator"&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>  

            <p>It is recommended to not include "image of" or "picture of" within your alt attribute text as it's assumed your text refers to an image, so there's no need to specify that.</p>         

            <h2>Adding dimensions to images</h2>

            <p>When considering performance, adding dimensions to your images is recommended. Dimensions allow the page to be laid out with the appropriate space for the image before the image itself has been downloaded. This avoids a layout shift as the image is downloaded and is something Chrome has recently started measuring in the <a href="https://web.dev/cls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a> metric.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;p&gt;Introductory paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="hero-image.jpg" alt="This is a hero image"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elitâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Adding width and height attributes to your &lt;img&gt; markup is now recommended. Without dimensions, this may render in two stages. The first stage as the HTML is downloaded and the second stage once the image is downloaded. This would cause the main content to jump down after the image is downloaded and the space needed to display the image can be calculated. This is very disrupting to the user.</p>

            <img class="img" src="img/01-layout-shift-after-image-loads.png" width="600" height="240" alt="Layout shifts after image loads" loading="lazy">

            <p>An image example with width and height dimensions:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
&lt;img src="image.jpg" width="600" height="240" alt="An example alt text"&gt;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>How CSS Interacts with dimensions</h2>

            <p>Dimensions such as widths and heights on an image can cause issues when you try to alter them using CSS. For example, if you want to limit your images to a certain width you might use the following CSS:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
img {
    max-width: 100%;
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>This will override the width of the image and constrain it when necessary. If you have explicitly set the height on the image tag, then we are not overriding that (only the width) and you will end up with a stretched or squashed image as we have no longer maintain the aspect ratio of the image.</p>

            <p>This can easily be fixed by adding the height property with the value of auto to your CSS so the height attribute from the HTML is overridden too.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>
