        	<h1>JavaScript Functions</h1>

            <p>Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function rather than repeating the same set of statements.</p>

            <p>A function is declared, or defined, using the <strong>function keyword</strong>. Below is the syntax for a function in JavaScript.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function nameOfFunction() {
    // Code to be executed
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>The steps that the function needs to perform its task are packages up within a <strong>code block</strong>.</p>

            <p>Statements in a function are not always executed when a page loads. For example, you may have a task you only want to perform if the user clicks on a specific element, such as button, on the page.</p>

            <p>If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give the function a name. This name should describe the task the function is performing. This is known as <strong>calling</strong> the function. Nothing will happen and no code will execute until we call, or <strong>invoke</strong> the function.</p>

            <p>When you write a function and expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a <strong>return value</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Declaring a Function</h2>

            <p>To create a function, you give it a name then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a <strong>function declaration</strong>.</p>

            <p>You declare a function using the function keyword followed by the function name (often called the <strong>identifier</strong>). The function name is followed by parenthesis.</p>

            <p>The statements that perform the task sit in a code block (inside the curly braces). The script can ask to perform the task whenever needed.</p>

            <p>This function is very basic, it only contains one statement inside of the code block, but illustrates how to write a function. Most functions that you see or write are likely to consist of more than one statement.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function sayHello() {
    document.write("Hello");
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Calling a Function</h2>

            <p>Having declared a function, you can then execute all of the statements between the curly braces with a single line of code. This is known as <strong>calling the function</strong>.</p>

            <p>To run the code in the function, use the function name followed by parenthesis. You would therefore say the code calls the function. You can call the function as many times as you like within the same script.</p>

            <p>The function executes the code within the code block. When its finished, the code continues to run from the point where it was initially called.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
sayHello();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Sometimes you will see a function called before it has been declared. This still works as the interpreter runs through the script before executing each statement so it will know that a function declaration appears later in the script. Ideally, declaring the function before calling it is the best solution.</p>

            <h2>Function Parameters</h2>

            <p>In our earlier example, we created a very simple function that prints "Hello" to the page. Using parameters, we can make the code more flexible. Parameters allow values to be passed into functions and behave in a similar way to local variables. Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task and this is why parameters are useful.</p>

            <p>Perhaps when a user logs into an application, we may want to greet them by name, instead of just saying "Hello".</p>

            <p>We can add a parameter into our function, called name, to represent the name of the person being greeted. The parameters we want to add to the function should be placed inside the parenthesis of the function.</p>

            <p>Inside the function, instead of a static string, we have a template literal string containing our parameter which now behaves as a local variable.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function sayHello(name) {
    document.write(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>We can of course write this example without using a template literal string.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function sayHello(name) {
    document.write("Hello, " + name);
}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>      

            <p>You'll notice that we haven't defined the value of name anywhere. We assign a value when we invoke, or call, our function. Assuming our user is named 'Dan', we'll call the function and place the username as the <strong>argument</strong>. The argument is the actual value that gets passed into the function.</p>  

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
sayHello("Dan");
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>This function will calculate and return the area of a rectangle. To do this, it needs the rectangle's width and height. Each time you call the function these values could be different. When you design a script, you need to note the information the function will require in order to perform its task.</p>

            <p>More than one parameter can be used in a function. We can pass multiple values into a function and return a value.</p>

            <p>In this example, the parameter names are used just as you would use variables. Here, the parameter names width and height represents the width and height values.</p> 

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function getArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}

getArea(20, 40);        // 800
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>   

            <p>When the <strong>return</strong> keyword is used, the function ceases to execute and the value of the expression is returned. The interpreter leaves the function when return is used and goes back to the statement that called it. Statements after the return would not be processed. For example, they perform a calculation and return the result.</p>

            <p>In this next example, we can also demonstrate how a function can be used to perform the same staps with different values.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function getArea(width, height) {
    var area = width * height;
    return area;
}

var areaOne = getArea(3, 5);
var areaTwo = getArea(8, 5);
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <ul>
                <li>The getArea() function returns the area of a rectangle to the code that called it.</li>
                <li>Inside the function, a variable called area is created. It holds the calculated area.</li>
                <li>The return keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting Multiple Values</h2>

            <p>Functions can return more than one value using an array. For example, this function calculates both the area and volume.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function getSize(width, height, depth) {
    var area = width * height;
    var volume = width * height * depth;
    var sizes = [area, volume];

    return sizes;
}

var areaOne = getSize(3, 2, 3)[0];      // Area
var areaTwo = getSize(3, 2, 3)[1];      // Volume
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <ul>
                <li>First, a new function is created called getSize(). The area of the box is calculated and stored in a variable called area.</li>
                <li>The volume is calculated and stored in a variable called volume. Both are then placed into an array named sizes.</li>
                <li>The array is then returned to the code that called the getSize() function, allowing the values to be used.</li>
                <li>The areaOne variable holds the area of the box that is 3 x 2. The area is the first value in the array [0].</li>
                <li>The areaTwo variable holds the volume of the box, 3 x 2 x 3. The volume is the second value in the array [1].</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Default Parameters</h3>

            <p>Default parameters were introduced as part of the ECMAScript 2015/6 (ES6) syntax. This allows developers to initialize a function with default values if the arguments are not supplied to the function call. This helps to make your functions easier to read and less error-prone, but also to provide default behaviour to yoyr functions. This will help avoid errors that stem from passing in undefined arguments.</p>

            <p>In the following code block, a function that returns the cube of a given number, defined as 'x'.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function cube(x) {
    return x * x * x;
}       
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>The 'x' variable in this example is a parameter. We can now call this function and pass a value of '10' as an argument into the function. Often the value will be contained in a variable as well, such as in this example:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
// Assing a number to a variable
const number = 10;

// Invoke the cube function
cube(number);    
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>If you do not pass an argument to a function that expects one, the function will implicitly use <strong>undefined</strong> as the value and return <strong>NaN</strong> or "Not a Number". In this case, the function is trying to calculate the value of undefined * undefined * undefined, which results in NaN.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
// Invoke the cube function without an argument
cube();    
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>Without default parameters, you would normally have to explcitly check for undefined values in order to set defaults, as shown in this example, using a conditional statement to check if the value has been automaticallt provided as undefined and then setting a default value of 'x' as 5, if it is.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function cube(x) {

    // Check to see if an argument is undefined
    if (typeof x === 'undefined') {
        // Set a default value if argument is undefined
        x = 5;
    }

    return x * x * x;
}  

// Invoke the cube function without an argument
cube();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>In contrast, using default parameters accomplishes the same goal with much less code. You can set a default value to the parameter in the function using the <strong>assignment operator</strong> (=).</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function cube(x = 5) {
    return x * x * x;
}  

// Invoke the cube function without an argument
cube();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>This function will now work by setting the default value to be '5', but will still function as intended when an argument is passed, ignoring the default value:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
// Invoke the cube function wit an argument, returns 8
cube(2);
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>Additional default parameters can also be used, if required.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
const area = function(width = 20, height = 40) {
    return width * height;
}

// Invoke the function without arguments
area();        
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <h2>Function Expressions</h2>

            <p>Previously, we used a function declaration in most examples. We can also create a function expression by assigning a function to a variable.</p>

            <p>Using the same getArea function example, we can directly apply the returned value to a variable, in this case area.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
const area = function getArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}

// Invoke the function to find the area
area(20, 40);        
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>Now the area constant is a function. We can make this expression more concise by turning it into an <strong>anonymous function</strong>, which is an unnamed function. Currently, our function has a name of getArea, but with a function expression, it's not necessary and usually omitted.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
const area = function(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}

// Invoke the function to find the area
area(20, 40);        
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>A named function expression might be used to aid in debugging, but it is usually omitted.</p>

            <h2>Arrow Functions</h2>

            <p>A newer, more concise method of defining a function is known as the Arrow Function expressions. This is parrt of ES6 (ECMAScript 6). Arrow functions, as they are commonly known, are represented by an equals sign followed by a greater than sign (=&gt;).</p>

            <p>Arrow functions are always anonymous funcctions and a type of a function expression. Instead of writing out function, we use the =&gt; arrow to indicate a function.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
const area = (width, height) => {
    return width * height;
}

// Invoke the function to find the area
area(20, 40);        
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>If a function has just a single parameter, the parenthesis can be excluded. In this example, we are squaring 'x', which only requires one number to be passed as an argument.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
const squared = x => {
    return x * x
}        

// Invoke the function to find the value
squared(8)
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre> 

            <p>If a function has no paremeters, an empty set of parenthesis () is required.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
const sayHello = () => {
    document.write("Hello");
}        

// Invoke the function
sayHello()
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>
