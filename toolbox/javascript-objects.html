        	<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>

            <p>Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. In an object, variables become known as <strong>properties</strong> and functions become known as <strong>methods</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Built-in Objects</h2>

            <p>Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.</p>

            <p>The three sets of built-in objects each offer a different range of tools that help you to write scripts for web pages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Browser Object Model (BOM)</strong> - The Browser Object Model contains the objects that represent the current browser window or tab. It contains objects that model things like browser history and the device's screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> - The Document Object Model uses objects to create a representation of the current page. It creates a new object for each element (and each individual section of text) within the page. The DOM is used to access and update the contents of a web page.</li>
                <li><strong>Global JavaScript Objects</strong> - The global JavaScript objects represent things that the JavaScript language needs to create a model. For example, there is an object that deals only with dates and times.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>As soon as a web page has loaded into your browser, these objects are available for use in your script.</p>

            <p>Just like any other object, dot notation can be used to access their properties and methods.</p>

            <p>The objects you create will usually be specifically written for your needs and contain functionality, or model the data needed by your script. Built-in functions contain functionality commonly needed by many scripts.</p>

            <p>An <strong>object model</strong> is a group of objects, each of which represent related things from the real world. Together they form a model of something larger.</p>

            <h3>Browser Object Model</h3>

            <p>The Browser Object Model (BOM) creates a model of the browser tab or window. The topmost object is the window object, which represents the current browser window or tab. Its child objects represent other browser features.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
Window
  |- Document
  |- History
  |- Location
  |- Navigator
  |- Screen
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Window</strong> - The current browser window or tab</li>
                <li><strong>Document</strong> - The current web page</li>
                <li><strong>History</strong> - The pages in the browser history</li>
                <li><strong>Location</strong> - URL of the current page</li>
                <li><strong>Navigator</strong> - Information about the browser</li>
                <li><strong>Screen</strong> - The device's display information</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The <strong>window</strong> object's <strong>print()</strong> method will cause the browser's print dialog box to be shown.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
window.print();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>The <strong>screen</strong> object's <strong>width</strong> property will let you find the width of the device's screen in pixels.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
window.screen.width;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h3>Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>

            <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) creates a model of the current web page. The topmost object is the <strong>document</strong> object, which represents the page as a whole. Its child objects represent other items on the page include: &lt;html&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, and text.</p>

            <p>The document object's getElementById() method gets an element by the value of its id attribute.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
document.getElementById('one');
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>The document object's <strong>lastModified</strong> property will tell you the date that the page was last updated.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
document.lastModified;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h3>Global JavaScript Objects</h3>

            <p>The global objects do not form a single model, they are a group of individual objects that relate to different parts of the JavaScript language. The names of global objects usually start with an uppercase letter.</p>

            <p>The String object's <strong>toUpperCase()</strong> method makes all letters in a variable uppercase.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
hotel.toUpperCase();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>The Math object's <strong>PI</strong> property will return the value of Pi.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
Math.PI();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Date &amp; Time</h2>

            <p>In order to work with dates, you create an instance of the <strong>Date</strong> object. You can then specify the time and date that you want to represent.</p>

            <p>The Date() object constructor tells the JavaScript interpreter that this variable is a date and this in turn allows you to use the Date object's methods to set and retrieve dates and times from this object.</p>

            <p>To create a Date object, use the <strong>Date()</strong> object constructor. The syntax is the same for creating any object with a constructor function and it can be used to create more than one Date object. This is very similar to how you use the <strong>Object()</strong> constructor to create a new object.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var today = new Date();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Here you can see we are using the <strong>new</strong> keyword and an <strong>assignment operator</strong> (<strong>=</strong>) to assign the date and time to a variable.</p>

            <p>By default, the Date object will hold today's date and the current time. In JavaScript, dates are stored as a number, the milliseconds since midnight on January 1, 1970 (Unix time/epoch) and is determined by the computer's clock of the user. If you want it to store another date, you must explicitly specify the date and time you want it to hold.</p>

            <p>Once the new Date object is created, the date and time will be contained when the JavaScript interpreter encountered the line of code. Once this instance is created, you can use the properties and methods of the Date object.</p>

            <p>Here we will use the <strong>getFullYear()</strong> method of the Date object to return the year of the date being stored in the Date object.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var today = new Date();
var year = today.getFullYear();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Creating Objects</h2>

            <p>To create an empty object literal, use:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var hotel = {}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Properties tell us about the object. Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.</p>

            <p>This object represents a hotel. It has five properties and one method. The object is in curly braces and is stored in a variable called hotel.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var hotel = {
    name: 'Quay',
    rooms: 40,
    booked: 25,
    gym: true,
    roomTypes: ['twin', 'double', 'suite'],

    checkAvailability: function() {
        return this.rooms - this.booked;
    }
};
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>This is an example of <strong>literal notation</strong>. This is the easiest and most popular way to create objects in JavaScript.</p>

            <p>The object is stored in a variable called <strong>hotel</strong>, so you would refer to it as the hotel object.</p>

            <p>Like variables and functions, properties and methods have a name and a value. In an object, the name is called a <strong>key</strong>. Each key and value is separated with a comma. An object cannot have two keys with the same name. The value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or another object. The value of a method is always a function.</p>

            <p>In the checkAvailable() method, the <strong>this</strong> keyword is used to indicate that it is using the <strong>rooms</strong> and <strong>booked</strong> properties of this object.</p>

            <p>The <strong>function</strong> keyword can also be omitted when assigning methods to an object.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var hotel = {
    name: 'Quay',
    rooms: 40,
    booked: 25,
    gym: true,
    roomTypes: ['twin', 'double', 'suite'],

    checkAvailability() {
        return this.rooms - this.booked;
    }
};
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Constructor Notation</h2>

            <p>The new keyword and object constructor can be used to create a new blank object. You can then add properties and methods to this object. The <strong>Object()</strong> constructor is a function that's part of the JavaScript language and is used to create objects. Once an object has been created, dot notation can be used to add the properties and methods.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
// Create a new blank object
var hotel = new Object();

// Add properties and methods to this object
hotel.name = 'Quay';
hotel.rooms = 40;
hotel.booked = 25;

hotel.checkAvailability = function() {
    return this.rooms - this.booked;  
};
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>Sometimes you may need many objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template fo creating objects. In this example, we are using a function to create a <strong>template</strong> with the object's methods and properties.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
function Hotel(name, rooms, booked) {
    
    this.name = name;
    this.rooms = rooms;
    this.booked = booked;

    this.checkAvailability = function() {
        return this.rooms - this.booked;
    };

}
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>  

            <p>Here a function called Hotel will be used as a template for creating new objects that represent hotels. Like all functions, it contains statements. In this case, the statements add properties and methods to the object.</p>

            <p>This function has three parameters, each sets the value of a property in the object. The methods will be the same for each object created using this template (function).</p>

            <p>The <strong>this</strong> keyword is used instead of the object name to indicate that the property or method belongs to thee object that <strong>this</strong> function creates.</p>  

            <p>The name of the function usually begins with an uppercase letter to help remind developers to use the <strong>new</strong> keyword when they create an object using this template function.</p>  

            <h3>Instances of the Template</h3>

            <p>You create instances of the object using the constructor function. The <strong>new</strong> keyword followed by the call to the function creates a new object using the template. The properties for each object you create are given as arguments to be passed into the function parameters.</p>

            <p>Here, two objects are created to represent two hotels. Each object needs a different name. When the <strong>new</strong> keyword calls the constructor function, it creates a new object. Each time it is calld, the arguments passed into the function are different because they are properties of two different hotels. Both objects automatically get the same methods defined within the function (the checkAvailability() method).</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var quayHotel = new Hotel('Quay', 40, 25);
var parkHotel = new Hotel('Park', 120, 77);
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>      

            <p>This technique maybe used if your script contains a complex object that needs to be available but might not be used. The object is defined in the function, but only created if it's needed.</p>

            <p>Even when many objects are created using the same constructor function, the methods stay the same because they access, update, or  perform a calculation based on the data stored in the properties.</p>        

            <h2>Accessing an Object</h2>

            <p>You can access the properties or methods of an object using <strong>dot notation</strong>. Square brackets can also be used.</p>

            <p>To acceess a property or method of an object, use the name of the object followed by a period (<strong>member operator</strong>), then the name of the property of method you want to access.</p>

            <p>Here are two variables created to hold the name of the hotel and the number of vacant rooms:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var hotelName = hotel.name;
var roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>You can also access the properties of an object using square brackets, but not methods. This time the object name is followed by square brackets and the property name is inside.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
var hotelName = hotel['name'];
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <h2>Updating an Object</h2>

            <p>To update the value of a property inside an object, use dot notation once again but using the <strong>assignment operator</strong> (=) to assign a new value. The same method to get a value is used to set a new value. Here, the name of the hotel is updates from 'Quay' to 'Park':</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
hotel.name = 'Park';
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>If the property you are attempting to update does not exist, it will be added as a new property to the object.</p>

            <p>To delete a property from an object, use the <strong>delete</strong> keyword followed by the object name and property name.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
delete hotel.name;
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>

            <p>If you want to clear a value of a property, set the value to be a blank string.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
hotel.name = '';
<!-- Just leave this line alone -->
    </code>
</pre>
