    <h1>Agile Methodology &amp; Development</h1>

    <p>The Agile Methodology is a particalar approach to project management that is utilised in software development. This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictabiity of building software. It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as Sprints.</p>

    <p>A Sprint is a period of time allocated for a particular phase of a project. Sprints are considered to be complete when the time period expires. This is usually measured as one week or two. Iteration is used to describe this development cycle.</p>

    <h2>Stand-up</h2>

    <p>A daily progress meeting, traditionally held within the development area.</p>

    <h2>Story</h2>

    <p>A particular business need to be assigned to the software development team. Stories must be broken down into small enough components that they may be delivered in a single development iteration.</p>

    <h2>Timebox</h2>

    <p>A defined period of time during which a task must be accomplished.</p>

    <h2>Spike</h2>

    <p>A story that cannot be estimated until a development team runs a time-boxed investigation.</p>

    <h2>Scrum</h2>

    <p>Scrum is an agile way to manage a project, usually a software development project. This is often perceived as a methodology or framework.</p>
