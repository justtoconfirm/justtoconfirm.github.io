    <h1>Developer Setup</h1>

    <h2>Bash Scripts</h2>
    <!-- https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-and-use-bash-scripts/ -->

    <p>Bash scripting is extremely useful and useful for interacting with Bash (a Unix shell) that is available by default on Linux and MacOS operating systems.</p>

    <p>Examples will be based on MacOS and will be using /Users/your_username</p>

    <p>The first step is to create a bin directory. bin is the standard naming convention of a subdirectory that contains executable programs. You can make sure you're in the main user directory by navigating to ~ (which is a shortcut for the current home directory - /Users/your_username). This will be the default directory the Terminal always open in. Typing pwd will confirm the location also.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ pwd
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Create bin in that folder, or wherever you want your bash scripts to live.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ cd ~          # This takes us to /Users/your_username
$ mkdir bin     # This creates /Users/your_username/bin
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Within your .bash_profile, you will need to add the following line to export your bin directory to the PATH:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/your_username/bin
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>If you don't see hidden files and directories, press CMD + SHIFT + ..</p>

    <p>Go to your bin folder located in /Users/your_username, create a file named hello-world, with no extension and open the file. Add the following line to this file:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
#!/bin/bash
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>A bash script must always begin with this to signify that the script should run with bash as opposed to any other shell. This is called a "shebang".</p>

    <p>Update the file to look like this:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
#!/bin/bash

echo Hello, World!
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once the bash script is created, it is advised to close the terminal and re-open it.</p>

    <p>Now, run the file in the terminal:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ hello-world
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This won't work as we have to make our file executable by changing the permissions:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ chmod u+x hello-world
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>You will need to cd into the bin directory to set the permissions.</p>

    <p>Now when you run the command, it will output the contents of the echo statement.</p>

    <p>A bash script can use any commands that you can use on the command line. We could use a bash script to prompt a use for a git commit message and the process of adding, committing, and pushing to origin so it can be done with a single git-deploy command:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
#!/bin/bash

read -r -p 'Commit message: ' desc  # prompt user for commit message
git add .                           # track all files
git add -u                          # track deletes
git commit -m "$desc"               # commit with message
git push origin master              # push to origin
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Bash Profile</h2>

    <p>The .bash_profile is a file that is hidden on Mac OS (formally OS X) and loaded before the Terminal loads your shell environment. It contains all the startup configuration and preferences for your command line interface. Within it, you can change your terminal prompt, change the colours of the text, add aliases to functions, and much more.</p>

    <p>This file is often called a 'dot file' because of the '.' at the beginning of its name. You can view all invisible files in the Terminal by typing:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ ls -al
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Setting Prompt</h2>

    <p>One of the first customisations of the Bash shell is usually performed to change the default shell prompt to something more personal. The command to insert is:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
PS1=""
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Between the quotes is where the customised prompt will be placed.</p> 

    <h2>Setting Alias</h2>

    <p>You can set an alias to make commands shorter for frequently used functions.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
alias q='exit'
alias pd='pwd'

alias root='cd /'
alias home='cd ~'
alias dtop='cd ~/desktop'

# Example project directories
alias jsprojects='cd ~/projects/jsprojects'

# Example Git
alias g='git'
alias gs='git status'
alias com='git commit -m'
alias clone='git clone'
alias st='git stash'
alias add='git add .'
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>PATH</h2>

    <p>The PATH is an environmental variable that tells your shell where to look to execute files.</p>

    <h2>Terminal Colours: Git Branch</h2>

    <p>Often it can be nice to set the colour scheme for your terminal. When working with Git, it can also be useful to show what Git branch your on. If not already created, begin by creating a .bash_profile dotfile in your home directory.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ touch .bash_profile
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The bash_profile is a configuration file for bash shell. When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell it first reads and executes cmmands from the .bash_profile dotfile.</p>

    <p>When you open terminal, in Mac OS, it automatically prompts you with a bash shell. Bash is a unix based shell and is an acronym for Bourne-again shell.</p>

    <p>Open the newly created .bash_profile dotfile and add the following:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
export CLICOLOR=1
export LSCOLORS=ExFxBxDxCxegedabagacad
parse_git_branch() {
  git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
export PS1="\[\033[36m\]\u\[\033[m\]@\[\033[32m\]\h:\[\033[33;1m\]\w\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[m\]\$ "
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>You may need to close and reopen the terminal for this to take effect.</p>

    <p>When entering commands into the terminal, many examples will include a leading $ at the start. This is a common convention used to denote what follows as a command to be run. The command does not require $ to be added to the start of a command.</p>

    <h2>Editing .bash_profile using nano</h2>

    <p>To edit .bash_profile using nano, invoke the following command in the Terminal:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Any changes you make to the .bash_profile will be applied next time you launch the terminal. If you want to apply them immediately, run the command below:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ source ~/.bash_profile
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Terminal commands</h2>

    <p>Here is a list and descriptions for key terminal commands:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ pwd - print working directory, the current location (working directory)

$ cd - change directory (without directory, takes you to home directory (~))
$ cd Documents - change directory to the 'Documents' directory
$ cd .. - from my Documents directory, take me up to my home directory

$ mkdir - make a new directory
$ mkdir myApp - make a new directory named 'MyApp'

$ touch - make a new empty file
$ touch MyApp - make a new empty file named 'MyApp'

$ cp - copy a file
$ mv - move a file
$ rm - remove a file or directory

$ clear - clear terminal
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Setup GitHub</h2>

    <p>The first thing you should do with Git is to set your global configuration. We can do this by running a lot of small commands which update the Git configuration file.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ git config --global user.name "First Last"
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Or, we can just create the Git configuration file within the home directory and input it all ourselves.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ touch .gitconfig
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Here I'll input my name, email, GitHub username and some aliases to be able to type less and do more. This will connect Git to the Mac OS Keychain so I don't have to type my username and password every time I want to push to GitHub.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
[user]
    name = First Last
    email = email@email.com
[github]
    user = username
[alias]
    a = add
    ca = commit -a
    cam = commit -am
    s = status
    pom = push origin master
    pog = push origin gh-pages
    puom = pull origin master
    puog = pull origin gh-pages
    cob = checkout -b
[credential]
    helper = osxkeychain
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>With the above aliases, I can run 'git s' instead of 'git status', for example.</p>

    <h2>Keychain</h2>

    <p>The Keychain in Mac OS is Apple's password management system. A keychain can store all your passwords for applications, servers, and websites. It was introduced in Mac OS 8.6 and has been included in all subsequent versions.</p>

    <h2>Making a Directory</h2>

    <p>You can use the following terminal command to make a new directory:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ mkdir

# Create a directory named 'my-app'
$ mkdir my-app
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Using the -p flag allows you to create multiple directories at once.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
# Create a 'js' directory within a 'src' directory
$ mkdir -p src/js
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Developer Tools (DevTools): Chrome</h2>

    <h3>Chrome Canary</h3>

    <p>Chrome Canary is the bleeding-edge version of Chrome. It's releases as soon as it's built, without testing.</p>

    <h3>Unused CSS &amp; JavaScript in Chrome</h3>

    <p>Within Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools) from Chrome 59, you can use the new Coverage tab to check for any unused CSS or JavaScript code. You need to open DevTools in Chrome, and open the Command Menu (CMD + SHIFT + P), then type <strong>'Coverage'</strong> to select <strong>'Show Coverage'</strong>. The Coverage tool will then be available. This will need to be used on each page and the more you interact with the UI/DOM, the more the tool will show if CSS or JavaScript is being used. Any unused CSS/JavaScript will be shown in red.</p>

    <p>It maybe possible for this process to be automated.</p>
