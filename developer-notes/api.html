    <h1>API &amp; HTTP Requests</h1>

    <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface, which can be defined as a set of methods/rules of communication between various software components. In other words, an API allows software to talk to other software applications/programs. A big part of working with JavaScript is knowing how to connect to APIs. Web APIs allow a web server to interact with third-party software. For example, a web server using a HTTP requests can communicate publicly within an available URL endpoint containing JSON data.</p>

    <p>You maybe familiar with the concept of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app. Any programming language can be used to make a CRUD app. A web API uses HTTP requests that correspond to the CRUD verbs - POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE.</p>

    <p>REST (Representative State Transfer) determines what the API looks like. It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API. One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data, called a resource, when you link to a specific URL. REST and RESTful APIs simply refer to a set of standards that conform to a specific architectural style. </p>

    <p>Each URL is called a request. The data sent back to you is called a response.</p>

    <p>The documentation for most APIs doesn't tend to give specific instructions for how to connect since APIs can be accessed by many different methods and languages - JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and so on.</p>

    <p>In our examples, we make reference to the GitHub API, but also the Studio Ghibli API which is a perfect API to use for testing. It can be located <a href="https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>API Analogy</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Take a restaurant</li>
        <li>The menu is the API</li>
        <li>Your order is the single API call via the waiter</li>
        <li>The food from the kitchen is the response</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Anatomy of a Request</h2>

    <p>A request is made up of four things:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The endpoint</li>
        <li>The method (HTTP)</li>
        <li>The headers</li>
        <li>The data (or body)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The endpoint</h2>

    <p>The endpoint, or route, is the URL you are requesting. To obtain the API endpoint, first read the API documentation and locate a GET request. Using the Studio Ghibli API, the 'films' section of the documentation will show the following:</p> 

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
GET /films
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This will shows us the URL of our API endpoint, <a href="https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films</a>. Clicking on that link will display an array of objects in JSON. If you do not have an extension for your browser to view JSON files, you may need to add one.</p>

    <p>The root-endpoint is the starting point of the API you're requesting. For example, the root-endpoint of GitHub's API is:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
https://api.github.com
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Paths</h3>

    <p>The path determines the resource you're requesting. To understand what paths are available to you, you need to look through the API documentation. For example, using the GitHub API, let's say you want to get a list of repositories for a specific GitHub user. The <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Developer documentation</a> tells you to use the following path to do so:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
GET /users/:username/repos
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Any colons (:) within a path denotes a variable. In our example from the GitHub documentation, the variable is ':username'. You should replace these values with actual values when you send your request. In this case, you should replace ':username' with the actual username of the user you're searching for. If I'm searching for my GitHub account, I'll replace ':username' with 'justtoconfirm'.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
GET /users/justtoconfirm/repos
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The path is then added to the end of the root-endpoint to make the request. This can be placed in the browser address bar to return the response.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
https://api.github.com/users/justtoconfirm/repos
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Query parameters</h3>

    <p>The final part of an endpoint is query parameters. Technically, query parameters are not part of the REST architecture, but many APIs use them. Query parameters give you the option to modify your request with key-value pairs and they always begin with a question mark (&#63;). Each parameter pair is then separated with an ampersand (&#38;). Within the GitHub documentation the query parameters will be listed under the 'Parameter' section of the documentation.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
?query1=value1&query2=value2
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>If you would like to get a list of the repositories that I pushed to recently, you can set the 'sort' query parameter to be the value of 'pushed'.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
https://api.github.com/users/justtoconfirm/repos?sort=pushed
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>The Method (HTTP method)</h2>

    <p>The method is the type of request that you send to the server. You can choose from these five types:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>GET - Used to get a resource from a server. The server will look for the data you requested and send it back to you. In other words, a 'GET' request performs a 'READ' operation. This is the default request method.</li>
        <li>POST - Used to create a new resource on the server. The server will create a new entry in the database. In other words, a 'POST' request performs a 'CREATE' operation.</li>
        <li>PUT/PATCH - Used to update a resource on a server. The server updates an entry in the database and tells you whether the update is successful. In other words, this request performs an 'UPDATE' operation.</li>
        <li>DELETE - Used to delete a resource from a server. The server will delete an entry in the database. In other words, it performs a 'DELETE' operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These methods provide meaning for the request you're making. They are used to perform CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (CRUD) actions.</p>

    <p>The API documentation will let you know what request method to use for each request. For example, to get a list of a user's repositories using the GitHub APU, you need a GET request:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
GET /users/:username/repos
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>To create a new GitHub repository (repo), you will need a POST request. Since POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE requests alter the database, developers almost always put them behind authentication. In some cases, a GET request may also require authentication. There are two main way to authenticate:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>With a username and password - basic authentication.</li>
        <li>With a token.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>oAuth is a token method that lets you authenticate yourself using websites and services such as GitHub, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>

    <p>If you try to send a POST request through GitHub's API without authentication, you will get a message returned saying 'Requires authentication'. You need to be authorized to perform this type of request.</p>

    <h2>Headers</h2>

    <p>Headers are used to provide information to both the client and server. It can be used for many purposes, including authentication and providing information about the body content.</p>

    <p>HTTP Headers are property-value pairs that are separated by a colon.</p>

    <p>The Content-Type header tells the client what the content type of the returned content actually is. In POST or PUT requests, the client tells the server what type of data is actually being sent.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>To view the request or response HTTP headers in Google Chrome:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Visit a URL.</li>
        <li>Open the Chrome Developer Tools.</li>
        <li>Select the 'Network' tab.</li>
        <li>Reload the page.</li>
        <li>Select any HTTP request on the left panel and the HTTP headers will be displayed on the right panel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Data (Body)</h2>

    <p>The body of a request - sometimes called 'data' or 'message' - contains information you want to be sent to the server. This is only used with POST, PUT/PATCH, or DELETE request.</p>

    <p>If you know how to spin up a server, you can make an API and test your own data.</p>

    <h2>JSON</h2>

    <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format for sending and requesting data through a REST API. The response that GitHub returns is formatted as JSON.</p>

    <p>A JSON object looks like a JavaScript object. Each property and value in JSON must be wrapped with double quotation marks.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
    "property1": "value1",
    "property2": "value2"
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>HTTP Status Codes &amp; Error Messages</h2>

    <p>Error messages, such as 'Requires authentication' and 'Problems parsing JSON' only appear when something is wrong with your request. HTTP status codes let you tell the status of the response quickly. In general, the following rules apply:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>200 - The request is successful.</li>
        <li>300 - The request is redirected to another URL.</li>
        <li>400 - An error that originates from the client has occurred.</li>
        <li>500 - An error that originates from the server has occurred.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example, if you make a POST request without providing a username or password, you may get a 401 status code (Unauthorized) returned. If your request is invalid because your data is wrong or missing, you usually get a 400 status code (Bad Request).</p>

    <h2>Retrieving data with HTTP requests</h2>

    <p>Let's open a connection to the API. We'll do so using the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, which is a way to open files and make an HTTP request. We'll create a request variable and assign a new XMLHttpRequest object to it. We will then open a new connection with the open() method. In the arguments, the request type of GET will be specified as well as the URL of the API endpoint. When the request completes, we can then access the data inside from inside the onload function.</p>

    <p>Once a HTTP request has been made, the object will contain useful information such as the response body and the HTTP status of the result.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// Create a request variable and assign a new XMLHttpRequest object to it
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();

// Open a new connection using the GET request on the URL endpoint
request.open('GET', 'https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films', true);

request.onload = function() {
    // Begin accessing JSON data here
}

// Send the request
request.send();
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>XMLHttpRequest (XHR)</h3>

    <p>XMLHttpRequest is a widely supported built-in method for making HTTP requests. It is used to interact with servers and can be used to retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a web page to update just parts of a page without having to do a full page refresh. XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is used heavily in AJAX. There is also a newer Fetch API which can be used for the same purpose, which is simpler but has less browser support.</p>

    <p>Despite its name, XMLHttpRequest can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML, and supports protocols other than HTTP (including file and ftp).</p>

    <p>Here is a simplified example using XMLHttpRequest:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
function reqListener() {
    console.log(this.responseText);
}

var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.addEventListener('load', reqListener);
request.open('GET', 'https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films', true);
request.send();
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Polling</h3>

    <p>Polling is the process of sending a request at a predetermined frequency and waiting for the endpoint to respond. If the endpoint doesn't respond, there are no new events to share.</p>

    <h3>Webhooks (HTTP push API)</h3>

    <p>Similar to polling, webhooks - also called HTTP push API - provides your application with a way of consuming new event data from an endpoint. However, instead of sending repeated requests for new events, you provide your endpoint with a URL which your application monitors. Whenever a new event occurs, it posts the event data to your specified URL, updating your application in real-time.</p>

    <p>Webhooks only transfer data when there is new data to send.</p>

    <h3>Working with JSON</h3>

    <p>Now a response has been received from our HTTP request, we can now work with it. The response is returned in JSON, so we will need to convert the JSON into JavaScript objects in order to work with it. We are going to use JSON.parse() to parse the response and create a data variable that contains all the JSON as an array of JavaScript objects. Using forEach(), we can then console log out the title of each filem to ensure it's working as expected.</p>

    <p>Place the following code inside the onload() function:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// Begin accessing the JSON data here
var data = JSON.parse(this.response);

// Using the forEach() method 
data.forEach(movie => {
    // Log each movie's title
    console.log(movie.title); 
});
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>When inspecting the HTML within the developer tools console, you should now see the titles of 20 Ghibli films.</p>

    <p>We are using the forEach() method to loop through the response. When using this method, we simply have to specify a callback function. The method itself has good browser support including support for IE10 and IE11. It should be possible to also use a for loop if you would prefer.</p>

    <p><a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=forEach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://caniuse.com/#search=forEach</a></p>

    <p>If we wanted to get the movie title and movie description, we can modify the code slightly:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
data.forEach(movie => {
    // Log each movie's title and description
    console.log(movie.title); 
    console.log(movie.description);
});
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We now need to deal with errors. If a wrong URL is used, or the URL is broken when an HTTP request is made, we need to deal with this. When an HTTP request is made, the response returns with HTTP status codes. 404 is the most well-known response, meaning Not Found, and 200 OK is a successful request.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// Begin accessing the JSON data here
var data = JSON.parse(this.response);

if (request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400) {
    data.forEach(movie => {
        // Log each movie's title
        console.log(movie.title); 
    });
} else {
    console.log('Error');
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Now let's show the whole code:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// Create a request variable and assign a new XMLHttpRequest object to it
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();

// Open a new connection using the GET request on the URL endpoint
request.open('GET', 'https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films', true);

request.onload = function() {
    // Begin accessing the JSON data here
    var data = JSON.parse(this.response);

    if (request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400) {
        data.forEach(movie => {
            // Log each movie's title
            console.log(movie.title); 
        });
    } else {
        console.log('Error');
    }
}

// Send the request
request.send();
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We have now successfully used a GET HTTP request to retrieve, or consume, the API endpoint which consisted of data in JSON format. We are still using the console, but we want to display the data on the front-end of the website. We can do this by modifying the DOM (Document Object Model).</p>

    <h2>Displaying the data</h2>

    <p>We're now going to display the data from our API within a HTML webpage. Begin by creating a new HTML document and adding the following code:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;API example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src="js/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>And now we can update the JavaScript to output the list of movies:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
// js/script.js

const app = document.getElementById('root');

const container = document.createElement('div');
container.setAttribute('class', 'container');

app.appendChild(container);

var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films', true);
request.onload = function () {

    // Begin accessing JSON data here
    var data = JSON.parse(this.response);
    
    if (request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400) {
        data.forEach(movie => {
            const card = document.createElement('div');
            card.setAttribute('class', 'card');

            const h1 = document.createElement('h1');
            h1.textContent = movie.title;

            const p = document.createElement('p');
            movie.description = movie.description.substring(0, 300);
            p.textContent = `${movie.description}...`;

            container.appendChild(card);
            card.appendChild(h1);
            card.appendChild(p);
        });
    } else {
        const errorMessage = document.createElement('div');
        errorMessage.textContent = `Gah, it's not working!`;
        app.appendChild(errorMessage);
    }
}

request.send();
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Fetch API</h2>

    <p>The Fetch API allows you to make network requests similar to the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object. The main difference is that the Fetch API uses Promises, which enables a simpler and cleaner API and avoiding callbacks or having to use the complex API of XHR.</p>

    <p>An XMLHttpRequest would need two listeners to be set to handle the success and error cases and a call to open() and send(), as this example below shows:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
function reqListener() {
    var data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    console.log(data);
}

function reqError(err) {
    console.log('Fetch Error', err);
}

var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.onload = reqListener;
oReq.onerror = reqError;
oReq.open('GET', 'https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films', true);
oReq.send();
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Our Fetch API request looks like this:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
fetch('https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films').then(
    function(response) {
        if (response.status !== 200) {
            console.log('Looks like there was a problem. Status code: ' + response.status);
            return;
        }

        // Examine the text in the response
        response.json().then(function(data) {
            console.log(data);
        });
    }
).catch(function(err) {
    console.log('Fetch Error', err);
});
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We may want to also view other metadata like headers when we make a request. When we make a fetch request, the response will be given a response.type of 'basic', 'cors' or 'opaque'. These types indicate where the resource has come from and can be used to inform you how to treat the response object. When a request is made for a resource on the same origin, the response will have a 'basic' type. If a request is made for a resource on another origin, the type maybe 'cors'. This type of response restricts the headers you can view to 'Cache-Control', 'Content-Language', 'Content-Type', 'Expires', 'Last-Modified', and 'Pragma'.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
fetch('https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films').then(
    function(response) {
        if (response.status !== 200) {
            console.log('Looks like there was a problem. Status code: ' + response.status);
            return;
        }

        // Examine the text in the response
        response.json().then(function(data) {
            console.log(data);

            // Headers
            console.log(response.headers.get('Content-Type'));  // application/json; charset=utf-8
            console.log(response.headers.get('Date'));  // null

            console.log(response.status);       // 200
            console.log(response.statusText);   // ok
            console.log(response.type);         // cors
            console.log(response.url);          // https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films
        });
    }
).catch(function(err) {
    console.log('Fetch Error', err);
});
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>HTTP &amp; HTTP Requests</h2>

    <p>HTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the underlying protocol (rules) that determines how messages are formatted as they are transmitted or received across the web. When you type the website URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in the URL bar, the DNS (Domain Name Server) resolves the URL into the appropriate IP address. The browser makes a request, a GET request, to the web server to GET the HTML of the site, the web server will then respond with a message such as "OK" which may have a status code of 200, and will then send the HTML down to the browser where it will be parsed and rendered. The GET request is referred to as an HTTP request. You are making a request to a server to get some data. If data is posted, such as a post added to a social media platform or data added to a database, a POST HTTP request is made.</p>

    <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) generally works by making HTTP requests to specific routes in a URL. Suppose we are making an API to talk to a database containing a list of books. We may be able to view those books at the URL .../books. A POST HTTP request to .../books will create a new book with whatever properties you define (think id, title, ISBN, author, publisher, etc) at the .../books route. We only care that the API exposes the endpoint (access through route) to manipulate the data. If we therefore then wanted to get a a specific book from it's id, we may use a HTTP GET request to the URL .../books/id where the ID is passed in as a known parameter.</p>

    <p>It's important to note that after making an HTTP request, we'll receive a response. We should always receive a status code. Earlier when we discussed the web server responding with "OK" this is known as an HTTP Status Code, more specifically, HTTP 200 OK. The status code just specifies how the operation or action specified at the endpoint completed. HTTP Status codes are sent back by the server. For example, if we make a GET request to search for a book using .../books/id where no such ID exists, then a HTTP 404 Not Found status code will be returned by the server.</p>
