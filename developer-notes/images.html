    <h1>Images</h1>

    <p>In HTML, images are defined with the &lt;img&gt; element. This element is empty (meaning that it has no text content or closing tag) and contains only attributes with no closing tag. The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image.</p>

    <p>Elements such as &lt;img&gt; and &lt;video&gt; are sometimes referred to as replaced elements. This is because the element's content and size are defined by an external resource - an image or video file - not by the contents of the element itself.</p>

    <p>The alt attribute provides an alternative text for an image should the user, for some reason, be unable to view it. The value of the alt attribute should describe the image. If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute. This is a required attribute. A web page wil not validate correctly without it.</p>

    <p>The alt attribute helps users who are visually impaired to use a screen reader that will read the web out to them. Having alt text available to describe images is useful to most users.</p>

    <h3>Decorative images &amp; alt</h3>

    <p>If the image you are using decoration/decorative images, then you should use CSS background images, but if you must use HTML, add a blank alt="". This will avoid a screen reader having to waste time reading the image if it's not part of the content.</p>

    <p>Further details can be found on the <a href="accessibility.html">accessibility</a> documentation.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
&lt;img src="images/bg-decoration.jpg" alt="" /&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
&lt;img src="images/flowers-chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania" /&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The width and height attributes always define the width and height of an image in pixles. Google recommends always setting the height and width of an image and to always specify the same height and width as the actual image so the browser doesn't have to do any modifications such as resizing.</p>

    <p>If no dimensions are specified, or the dimensions don't match those of the actual image, the browser will require a reflow and repaint once the image(s) are downloaded. The height and width should therefore be specified in the HTML attributes or in CSS.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
&lt;img src="images/flowers-chania.jpg" width="128" height="128" alt="Flowers in Chania" /&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Search engines also read image filenames and count them towards SEO. Therefore, give your images descriptive filenames, dinosaur.jpg is better than img835.jpg. It is recommended to always keep the images on the same server as your HTML.</p>

    <p>Pointing your src attribute to an image hosted elsewhere that you don't have permission to link to or use is called "hotlinking" and is not recommended. This also makes the browser do more work by looking up the IP address from the DNS server.</p>

    <h2>Images as Links</h2>

    <p>To use an image as a link, put the &lt;img&gt; tag inside the &lt;a&gt; tag. The image should be styled to have border: 0 (within the CSS), to prevent IE9 (Internet Explorer 9) and earlier browsers, from displaying a border around the image when the image is a link.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
&lt;a href="flower-tutorials.html"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/flowers.jpg" class="img" width="128" height="128" alt="Flower Tutorials" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>&lt;picture&gt;</h2>

    <p>HTML5 introduced the &lt;picture&gt; element to add more flexibility when specifying image resources. The &lt;picture&gt; element contains a number of &lt;source&gt; elements, each referring to different image sources. This way, the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view/device.</p>

    <p>The &lt;picture&gt; element accepts multiple image sources and empowers the browser to decide which image is appropriate based on the user's conditions. These conditions are often network speeds, or their screen resolution.</p>

    <p>You should always specify an &lt;img&gt; element as the last child element of the &lt;picture&gt; element. The &lt;img&gt; element is used by browsers that do not support the &lt;picture&gt; element, or if none of the &lt;source&gt; tags match.</p>

    <p>Here is the current support for the &lt;picture&gt; element according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=picture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caniuse.com</a></p>

    <p>While it is perfectly valid HTML5, not all browsers have implemented it fully. This is where the &lt;img&gt; element comes in. It is used when the browser doesn't understand what &lt;picture&gt; is.</p>

    <p>&lt;source&gt; elements are created for each separate image that you would want, or conditionally want, to render inside of the &lt;picture&gt; element. You can add as many of these as you require.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media="(min-width: 64rem)" srcset="img/sudden-valley.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;source srcset="img/sudden-valley_sm.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;img src="img/sudden-valley.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Source attributes</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>media - set a min/max width or height.</li>
        <li>srcset - set the path to the image and what width to use.</li>
        <li>type - set a MIME type for the image. If the user agent doesn't support the type, it's skipped.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The &lt;picture&gt; element is the container for the &lt;source&gt; and &lt;img&gt; elements. When the browser sees &lt;picture&gt; it determines which one makes the most sense for your user, based on media queries or other source attributes.</p>

    <h2>SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics</h2>

    <p>SVG is an XML-based vector image format (used to describe vector images) for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999. SVG images and their behaviours are defined in XML text files. It is basically markup, like HTML.</p>

    <p>SVG is not supported in IE8 (Internet Explorer 8) or Android 2.3 and below.</p>

    <p>Vector graphics are very useful in many circumstances. They have small file sizes, are highly scalable, so they don't pixellate when zoomed in or blown up to large sizes.</p>

    <h2>Raster Images</h2>

    <p>Raster images are defined using a grid of pixels. A Raster image file contains information showing exactly where each pixel is to be placed and exactly what colour it should be. Popular web raster formats include: Bitmap (.bmp), PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpg), and GIF (.gif).</p>

    <h2>Lazy Load Images</h2>

    <p>Lazy loading of images means loading images on websites asynchronously, that is after the above-the-fold content is fully loaded, or conditionally, only when they appear in the browser's viewport. This means that is users don't scroll all the way down, images placed at the bottom of the page won't even be loaded. Many websites use this approach and this is especially noticeable on image-heavy sites. Often you'll see placeholder images quickly filling up with real images for preview.</p>

    <p>Since most lazy loading solutions work by loading images only if the user has scrolled to the location where images would be visible inside the viewport, those images will never be loaded if users never get to that point. This can be ideal for slow-connections as it reduces the need for bandwidth if we don't have to load all the images initially, therefore improving website performance. JavaScript can be used to implement lazy loading within your website.</p>
