    <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>

    <h2>JavaScript &amp; HTML</h2>

    <p>When a browser comes across a &lt;script&gt; element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything. It is often recommended to place the &lt;script&gt; element just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; element within a HTML document.</p>

    <p>Should a &lt;script&gt; element be required to be in the &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML document, apply the async attribute.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
&lt;<span class="token-tag">body</span>&gt;

&lt;<span class="token-tag">script</span> <span class="token-attr-name">src</span>="<span class="token-attr-value">js/my-script.js</span>"&gt;&lt;<span class="token-tag">/script</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="token-tag">/body</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="token-tag">/html</span>&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The HTML &lt;script&gt; element is used to embed or reference executable code, typically JavaScript code. In HTML5, the type attribute is not required, but in HTML4 it will need to be applied.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">&lt;!-- HTML5 --&gt;</span>
&lt;<span class="token-tag">script</span> <span class="token-attr-name">src</span>="<span class="token-attr-value">js/my-script.js</span>"&gt;&lt;<span class="token-tag">/script</span>&gt;

<span class="token-punctuation">&lt;!-- HTML4 --&gt;</span>
&lt;<span class="token-tag">script</span> <span class="token-attr-name">type</span>="<span class="token-attr-value">text/javascript</span>" <span class="token-attr-name">src</span>="<span class="token-attr-value">js/my-script.js</span>"&gt;&lt;<span class="token-tag">/script</span>&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Comments</h2>

    <p>JavaScript supports two types of comments, the single-line comment and block comment.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// This is a single-line comment</span>

<span class="token-punctuation">/*
 * This is a multi-line comment
 * over multiple lines.
 */</span>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>A variable allows bits of information (data) to be stored within your script. Before you can use a variable, you need to declare (create) it. To declare a variable you need to use the <strong>var</strong> keyword. The JavaScript interpreter knows that this keyword is used to create a variable. In order to use the variable, you must give it a name. This is sometimes called an identifier. If a variable name is more than one word, it is usually written in camelCase. In this example, the variable is called quantity.</p>
    
    <p>A variable is a container for storing a value and must be declared before it can be used. JavaScript is an untyped language meaning that a JavaScript variable can hold a value of any data type. Unlike many other programming languages, you do not need to declare the data type the variable will hold as JavaScript handles this automatically during the execution of the code.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-keyword">var</span> quantity;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once you have created a variable, you can tell it the information you would like it to store. Programmers say that you assign a value to the variable. We use the assignment operator - the equal sign that follows the name of the variable - to assign a value. Until a value has been assigned to a variable, the value is undefined, an empty container.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-keyword">var</span> quantity = <span class="token-number-value">3</span>;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>var</h3>

    <p>The var declaration can be used to assign any unique variable a value. However, the usage of var comes with some rules.</p>

    <p>A var is mutable, meaning we can adjust the value of var whenever we'd like. For example:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
var name = "Dan";
name = "Matt";

console.log(name);      // Matt
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This flexibility is great, but can be dangerous. That's because var can be overwritten, as this next example show.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
var name = "Dan";
var name = "Matt";

console.log(name);      // Matt
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This example might look the same, but notice how we've used the var declaration again to reassign our values. This may not seem like a huge deal, but imagine we've written a program with thousands of lines of code and we then accidentally reuse the same var name. Our whole program may break.</p>

    <p>When we use variables we want them to be associated with a certain aspect of our code. Whether that's a function, a block, or globally, we don't want our variables leaking to other parts of our code.</p>

    <p>var is functioned scoped, meaning their scope is contained to the function that they're declared in.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
function name() {
    var first = "Dan";
}

console.log(first);     // ReferenceError: first is not defined
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We are unable to access the variable outside of the function. This is good as we want our function variables to be unique to the functions we declare them in. However, var is not block scoped meaning if a block is invoked, using { }, the var we declare is not limited to the block it's defined in.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
var name = "Matt";

if(true) {
    var name = "Dan";   // Variable reassigned in block
}

console.log(name);     // Dan
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Above, we see our global variable reassigned in a block. This is not ideal. If we needed our global variables to remain constant, but everytime a block appeared it got reassigned, it wouldn't be good.</p>

    <h3>let</h3>

    <p>let is similar to var, but it has resolved some of it's issues.</p>

    <p>let is great because its values are mutable and it will not allow us to overwrite it. JavaScript won't run our code if we try to overwrite. This is super useful if we accidentally reuse a variable name.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
let name = "Dan";
let name = "Matt";  // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>If we want to change the content of a let variable, we can follow this example:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
let name = "Dan";
name = "Matt";

console.log(name);      // Matt
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>As long as we don't rewrite the whole variable, we can reassign a value by just targeting the unique variable name.</p>

    <p>Unlike var, let is block scoped. When declared inside a { } it will not leak out. The variable in the block is totally ignored and the global scope only responds to global variables.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
let name = "Dan";

if(true) {
    let name = "Matt";
}

console.log(name);     // Dan
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We can show this as a function also.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
let name = "Dan";

function test() {
    let name = "Matt";
}

console.log(name);     // Dan
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Our variables are stuck to their scope, which is exactly where we want them.</p>

    <h3>const</h3>

    <p>const allows us to assign a value to a variable and keep it constant no matter what. It is not mutable and it cannot be overwritten.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
const name = "Dan";

const name = "Matt";    // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared

name = "Bob";   // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once we declare it, its here to stay. const is block scoped, meaning that it is locked to its declared area.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
const name = "Dan";

if(true) {
    const name = "Matt";
    const nickname = "Big";
}

console.log(name);      // Dan
console.log(nickname);      // Uncaught ReferenceError: nickname is not defined
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This power is great for variables we don't want to disturb and need to remain constant throughout our application. It is often better to declare your variables as const for as long as possible, that way we don't leave variables susceptible to mutability throughout our code. For those moments when we want mutability, we should use let.</p>

    <h2>Variable Scope</h2>

    <p>The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is known as the variable's scope. A variable created inside a function is called a local variable or function-level variable. It is said to have local scope and it cannot be accessed outside of the function. The JavaScript interpreter creates local variables when the function is called, and removes them as soon as the function has finished its task.</p>

    <p>If you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script. This is called a global variable and has global scope. Global variables are stored in memory and become a property of the window object for as long as the web page is loaded into the browser. The window object is supported by all browsers and represents the browser's window. This however means that they take up more memory than local variables and increases the risk of naming conflicts with other variables used. For this reason, you should use local variables wherever possible. Should you forget to declare a variable using the var keyword, the variable will work, but this too will be treated as a global variable and is considered bad practice as this pollutes the global namespace.</p>

    <p>Many sites may use scripts written by multiple developers. Using global variables can cause naming collisions as different scripts can use variables with the same name. Therefore, it is best practice to use local variables where possible.</p>

    <p>Variable declarations, wherever they occur, are processed before any code is executed. This is called hoisting. Because of this, declaring a variable anywhere within your code is the equivalent to declaring it at the top of your code. This means that a variable can appear to be used before it has been declared. For this reason, it is always recommended to always declare variables at the top of their scope, either within the global code or at the top of a function.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// Local scope</span>
function getArea(width, height) {
    var area = width * height;
    return area;
}

<span class="token-punctuation">// Global scope</span>
var wallSize = getArea(3, 2);
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Variables &amp; Memory</h2>

    <p>Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed. Each variable that you declare takes up memory. The more variables a browser has to remember, the more memory your script requires to run. Scripts that require a lot of memory can perform slower, which in turn makes your web page take longer to respond to the user.</p>

    <p>A variable actually references a value that is stored in memory. The same value can be used by more than one variable.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// Unique variable values in memory</span>
var width = 15;
var height = 30;

<span class="token-punctuation">// The same value of 'true' in memory</span>
var isBox = true;
var isSquare = true;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Array</h2>

    <p>An array is a variable that stores multiple values. You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain. For example, an array can be suited to storing the individual items on a shopping list because it is a list of related items.</p>

    <p>To create an array, you create a variable using the <strong>var</strong> keyword followed by the name of the array. The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, with each value being separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store strings, numbers, and booleans all in the same array. This technique for creating an array is known as an array literal and is the preffered method for creating an array.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
var colours = ['white', 'black', 'blue'];

colours;       <span class="token-punctuation">// (3) ["white", "orange", "blue"]</span>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. Each item in the array is automatically given a number called an index. This can be used to access specific items in the array. Index values start at 0 (not 1), so the first value/item in the array has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.</p>

    <p>To access the third item within the array, the array name is specified along with the index number of the item to be accessed. So if we want to access the third item in our array - which is 'blue' - we use index 2. Here you can see we have a new variable called itemThree. It's value is set to be the third colour from the colours array:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
var colours = ['white', 'black', 'blue']; 
var itemThree = colours[2];                
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Each array has a property called length. This holds the number of items within the array. Let's create a new variable that will store the length of the array. This should return '3':</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
var colours = ['white', 'black', 'blue']; 
var itemThree = colours[2];         
var totalItems = colours.length;    

itemThree;      <span class="token-punctuation">// blue</span>
totalItems;     <span class="token-punctuation">// 3</span>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Now if we want to update a value in the array, for example to change the colour 'black' to 'orange', we can do it this way:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
var colours = ['white', 'black', 'blue']; 
colours[1] = 'orange';
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p>Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task. A method is the same as a function, except methods are created inside (and are part of) objects. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function rather than repeating the same set of statements.</p>

    <p>When naming a function, the name should describe the task it is performing. When you want to use the function, it is known as calling the function. The steps that the function needs to follow in order to perform its task are packaged within a code block. A code block consists of one or more statements contained within curly braces.</p>

    <p>To create (declare) a function, you must give it a name (identifier) followed by paranthesis and then write the statements inside the curly braces of the code block. This is known as a function declaration. We declare the function using the function keyword. Having declared the function, you can then execute it. This is known as 'calling the function'. You can call the same function as many times as you like within the same JavaScript file.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// Declare the function</span>
function sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello World');
}

<span class="token-punctuation">// Calling the function</span>
sayHello();
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Sometimes you will see a function called before it is declared. This still works because the JavaScript interpreter runs through the script before executing each statement, so it will know that a function declaration appears later in the script.</p>

    <p>Functions sometimes need information that is specific to perform its task. In such cases, when declaring the function you give it parameters inside the function. The parameters act like variables. When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parenthesis that follow the name. The value you pass into the function parameters are called arguments.</p>

    <p>In the following example, width and height are parameters. When the function is called, the value of '3' and '5' are the arguments passed into these parameters.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// Declare function with parameters</span>
function getArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}

<span class="token-punctuation">// Calling the function with arguments</span>
getArea(3, 5);
        </code>
    </pre>
