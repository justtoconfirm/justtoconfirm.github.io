    <h1>Webpack</h1>

    <h2>Setup</h2>

    <p>We are going to begin by creating a project directory through the terminal and adding a package.json file where our dev dependencies will be added. You will need NPM (Node Package Manager) installed.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project

# Create the package.json file
$ npm init
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Next, we need to install Webpack as a module and webpack-cli to run it from within your terminal. Both modules will be installed as devDependencies.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once installed, open your package.json file and add a build script. In Wwebpack 4, you will need to ensure that your build script contains a mode flag.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// package.json

"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development"
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The default behaviour for Webpack 4, since it requires very little configuration, is that when you run the build script, Webpack will look for a folder named '.src/' in your project that contains an index.js file. Without this, Webpack will return an error within the terminal.</p>

    <p>Create a directory named 'src' in the root of your project directory that contains a file named index.js. Within this file, add the following code:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// src/index.js

console.log("hello, world");
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Now, lets open the terminal and run the build script we created earlier.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm run dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Running the build script will cause Webpack to bundle the JavaScript file and create a 'dist/' directory in your project. This new directory will contain the bundled file which is named as 'main.js' by default.</p>

    <p>The file structure below does not show the node_modules directory, to keep things simple. As Webpack 4 has no configuration to run initially, you will also not see a webpack.config.js file within our project at this time.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
my-project/
    dist/
        main.js
    src/
        index.js
    package.json
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Let's add another mode to a new build script within our package.json file.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
// package.json

"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Although Webpack 4 itself is mostly zero-configuration, this mostly applies to generaly defaults such as entry and output. A webpack.config.js file can be created to add further configuration.</p>
