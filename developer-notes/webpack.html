    <h1>Webpack</h1>

    <h2>Setup</h2>

    <p>We are going to begin by creating a project directory through the terminal and adding a package.json file where our dev dependencies will be added. You will need NPM (Node Package Manager) installed.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project

# Create the package.json file
$ npm init
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Next, we need to install Webpack as a module and webpack-cli to run it from within your terminal. Both modules will be installed as devDependencies.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once installed, open your package.json file and add a build script. In Wwebpack 4, you will need to ensure that your build script contains a mode flag.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// package.json

"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development"
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The default behaviour for Webpack 4, since it requires very little configuration, is that when you run the build script, Webpack will look for a folder named '.src/' in your project that contains an index.js file. Without this, Webpack will return an error within the terminal.</p>

    <p>Create a directory named 'src' in the root of your project directory that contains a file named index.js. Within this file, add the following code:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// src/index.js

console.log("hello, world");
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Now, lets open the terminal and run the build script we created earlier.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm run dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Running the build script will cause Webpack to bundle the JavaScript file and create a 'dist/' directory in your project. This new directory will contain the bundled file which is named as 'main.js' by default.</p>

    <p>The file structure below does not show the node_modules directory, to keep things simple. As Webpack 4 has no configuration to run initially, you will also not see a webpack.config.js file within our project at this time.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
my-project/
    dist/
        main.js
    src/
        index.js
    package.json
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Let's add another mode to a new build script within our package.json file.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// package.json

"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Although Webpack 4 itself is mostly zero-configuration, this mostly applies to generaly defaults such as entry and output. A webpack.config.js file can be created to add further configuration.</p>

    <h2>Babel &amp; ES6</h2>

    <p>Modern JavaScript code is mostly written in ES6, however, ES6 is not supported by all browsers. We therefore need to transpile it - a fancy word for turning your ES6 syntax into ES5 for use in all browsers. You can use Babel for this, a tool used to transpile ES6 into ES5 JavaScript.</p>

    <p>We can install a number of NPM (Node Package Manager) modules to use Babel with Webpack.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env --save-dev

// Alternative install
$ npm install "babel-loader@^8.0.0-beta" @babel/core @babel/preset-env --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>You may receive an error if you use the above modules. For example, babel-loader@8 requires Babel 7.x (the package @babel/core). If you'd like to use Babel 6.x ('babel-core'), you should install 'babel-loader@7'. Use the following modules, and this should fix the issue.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install @babel/core --save-dev
$ npm install @babel/preset-env --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Your package.json file should look like this:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
  "name": "webpack-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.1.6",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.1.6",
    "babel-loader": "^8.0.4",
    "webpack": "^4.26.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.1.2"
  }
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Next, create a .babelrc configuration file. Without this, Babel will not do anything. This needs to be placed within the root of your project directory.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ touch .babelrc
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The config file is empty. Open the .babelrc config file and add the following code:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>To apply Babel to Webpack and to further the configuration of Webpack, we need to use create a Webpack config file.</p>

    <h2>Webpack Config</h2>

    <p>The Webpack config file is placed within the root of your project directory and is named webpack.config.js. Although Webpack advertises itself as a zero-configuration platform, it mostly applies to general defaults such as as entry and output.</p>

    <p>Create a webpack.config.js file within your project directory and add the following code:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: { main: './src/index.js' },
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'main.js'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: "babel-loader"
                }
            }
        ]
    }   
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Your ES6 JavaScript will now be transpiled into ES5 syntax.</p>

    <h2>Using ES Modules with Webpack</h2>

    <p>Webpack handles JavaScript by default.</p>

    <p>Using ES <a href="javascript-modules.html">Modules</a>, you can split up your large programs/applications into many small, self-contained modules. Out of the box, Webpack knows how to consume ES modules using import and export statements. ES Modules are supported in Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox (since version 60).</p>

    <p>Note: imports without a relative path, are modules from NPM installed within the /node_modules directory. Your own modules will always need a relative path like './people', and this is how you can tell them apart.</p>

    <p>The process of removing unused imports is known as tree-shaking.</p>

    <h2>Loaders</h2>

    <p>Loaders let you run preprocessors on files as they're imported allowing you to bundle static resources beyond JavaScript. When implementing a loader, you may see the 'rules' property as an array of all of your loaders within the webpack.config.js file. These rules will be applied to every file that matches the 'test' property (a regular expression) of the rule.</p>

    <p>The property rules is an array of all of your loaders. These rules will be applied to every file that matches the test property.</p>

    <p>The property use is an indicator of which loader should be used for matching files.</p>

    <h3>CSS Loader</h3>

    <p>The css-loader interprets imported CSS files. Begin by install the CSS loader as a devDependency.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install css-loader --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once installed, update your Webpack config file.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
module: {
    rules: [
        {
            test: /\.css$/,
            use: ['css-loader']
        }
    ]
}   
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Code Splitting</h2>

    <p>Code splitting is a feature that allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. It can be used to achieve smaller bundles and control resource load prioritisation which, if used correctly, can have a major impact on load time.</p>

    <p>So far, we've seen only a single entry point - src/index.js - and a single output bundle - dist/bundle.js. As your application grows, you'll need to split this up so that the entire codebase isn't downloaded at the start. A good approach is to use Code Splitting and Lazy Loading to fetch things on demand as the code paths require them.</p>
