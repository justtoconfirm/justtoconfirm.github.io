    <h1>Webpack</h1>

    <h2>Setup</h2>

    <p>We are going to begin by creating a project directory through the terminal and adding a package.json file where our dev dependencies will be added. You will need NPM (Node Package Manager) installed.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project

# Create the package.json file
$ npm init
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Next, we need to install Webpack as a module and webpack-cli to run it from within your terminal. Both modules will be installed as devDependencies.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once installed, open your package.json file and add a build script. In Webpack 4, you will need to ensure that your build script contains a mode flag.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// package.json

"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development"
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The default behaviour for Webpack 4, since it requires very little configuration, is that when you run the build script, Webpack will look for a folder named '.src/' in your project that contains an index.js file. Without this, Webpack will return an error within the terminal.</p>

    <p>Create a directory named 'src' in the root of your project directory that contains a file named index.js. Within this file, add the following code:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// src/index.js

console.log("hello, world");
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Now, lets open the terminal and run the build script we created earlier.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm run dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Running the build script will cause Webpack to bundle the JavaScript file and create a 'dist/' directory in your project. This new directory will contain the bundled file which is named as 'main.js' by default.</p>

    <p>The file structure below does not show the node_modules directory, to keep things simple. As Webpack 4 has no configuration to run initially, you will also not see a webpack.config.js file within our project at this time.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
my-project/
    dist/
        main.js
    src/
        index.js
    package.json
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Let's add another mode to a new build script within our package.json file.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// package.json

"scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Although Webpack 4 itself is mostly zero-configuration, this mostly applies to generaly defaults such as entry and output. A webpack.config.js file can be created to add further configuration.</p>

    <h2>Babel &amp; ES6</h2>

    <p>Modern JavaScript code is mostly written in ES6, however, ES6 is not supported by all browsers. We therefore need to transpile it - a fancy word for turning your ES6 syntax into ES5 for use in all browsers. You can use Babel for this, a tool used to transpile ES6 into ES5 JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Here are the packages we install for React:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>@babel/core - The main dependency that includes babel transform script.</li>
        <li>@babel/preset-env - The default Babel preset used to transform ES6+ into valid ES5 code. Optionally configures browser polyfills automatically.</li>
        <li>@babel/preset-react - Used for transforming JSX and React class syntax into valid JavaScript code.</li>
        <li>babel-loader - A webpack loader that hooks Babel into Webpack. We can run Babel from Webpack using this package.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may want to also setup a .browserslistrc file that will include a list of browsers supported by Babel preset-env.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ touch .browserslistrc
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This file will be setup in the root directory of your project. The file itself will be referenced automatically and can include the setup, as so:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
> 1%
last 2 versions
not ie < 11
ie6
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>StandardJS can be used for linting and to prevent the use of trailing commas in JavaScript objects.</p>

    <p>We can install a number of NPM (Node Package Manager) modules to use Babel with Webpack.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env --save-dev

// Alternative install
$ npm install "babel-loader@^8.0.0-beta" @babel/core @babel/preset-env --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>@babel is the stable/latest released version of Babel. We are also installing preset-env which allows us to target browsers that you want to target.</p>

    <p>You may receive an error if you use the above modules. For example, babel-loader@8 requires Babel 7.x (the package @babel/core). If you'd like to use Babel 6.x ('babel-core'), you should install 'babel-loader@7'. Use the following modules, and this should fix the issue.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install @babel/core --save-dev
$ npm install @babel/preset-env --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Your package.json file should look like this:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
  "name": "webpack-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.1.6",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.1.6",
    "babel-loader": "^8.0.4",
    "webpack": "^4.26.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.1.2"
  }
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Next, create a .babelrc configuration file. Without this, Babel will not do anything. This needs to be placed within the root of your project directory.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ touch .babelrc
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The config file is empty. Open the .babelrc config file and add the following code:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
    "presets": [ "@babel/preset-env" ]
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>To apply Babel to Webpack and to further the configuration of Webpack, we need to use create a Webpack config file.</p>

    <p>When working with React, we may need to install a further package using NPM. We need to install the @babel/preset-react package as a devDependency.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install @babel/preset-react --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The .babelrc config file needs to also be updated:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
    "presets": [ 
        "@babel/preset-env", 
        "@babel/preset-react" 
    ]
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Your package.json file should look something like this:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
  "name": "webpack-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.1.6",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.1.6",
    "@babel/preset-react": "^7.0.0",
    "babel-loader": "^8.0.4",
    "webpack": "^4.26.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.1.2"
  }
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Webpack Config</h2>

    <p>The Webpack config file is placed within the root of your project directory and is named webpack.config.js. Although Webpack advertises itself as a zero-configuration platform, it mostly applies to general defaults such as as entry and output.</p>

    <p>Here is a very basic webpack.config.js file:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\/(js|jsx)$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: "babel-loader"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Create a webpack.config.js file within your project directory and add the following code:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: { main: './src/index.js' },
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'main.js'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: "babel-loader"
                }
            }
        ]
    }   
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Your ES6 JavaScript will now be transpiled into ES5 syntax.</p>

    <p>The Webpack config is basically saying that the entry point of our application is from index.js, so pull everything that's needed by that file then put the output of the bundling process into the dist directory named main.js.</p>

    <h2>Using ES Modules with Webpack</h2>

    <p>Webpack handles JavaScript by default.</p>

    <p>Using ES <a href="javascript-modules.html">Modules</a>, you can split up your large programs/applications into many small, self-contained modules. Out of the box, Webpack knows how to consume ES modules using import and export statements. ES Modules are supported in Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox (since version 60).</p>

    <p>Note: imports without a relative path, are modules from NPM installed within the /node_modules directory. Your own modules will always need a relative path like './people', and this is how you can tell them apart.</p>

    <p>The process of removing unused imports is known as tree-shaking.</p>

    <h2>Loaders</h2>

    <p>Loaders let you run preprocessors on files as they're imported allowing you to bundle static resources beyond JavaScript. When implementing a loader, you may see the 'rules' property as an array of all of your loaders within the webpack.config.js file. These rules will be applied to every file that matches the 'test' property (a regular expression) of the rule.</p>

    <p>The property rules is an array of all of your loaders. These rules will be applied to every file that matches the test property.</p>

    <p>The property use is an indicator of which loader should be used for matching files.</p>

    <h3>CSS Loader</h3>

    <p>The css-loader interprets imported CSS files. Begin by install the CSS loader as a devDependency.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install css-loader --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once installed, update your Webpack config file.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
module: {
    rules: [
        {
            test: /\.css$/,
            use: ['css-loader']
        }
    ]
}   
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Bundle Splitting</h2>
    <!-- https://hackernoon.com/the-100-correct-way-to-split-your-chunks-with-webpack-f8a9df5b7758 -->
    <p>The idea behind bundle splitting is pretty simple. If you have one giant file, the bundle, and you change one line of code, the user must download the entire file once again. If you split this into two files, then the user would only need to download the one that changes and the browser would serve the other file from the cache.</p>

    <p>It's worth noting that since bundle splitting relates to caching, it makes no difference to first time visitors.</p>

    <p>When we use cache busting when referring to a bundled JavaScript file, such as main.js, what we actually mean is something like: main.12etrsd.js, where the string of characters is a hash of the contents of the file. This means a different file name is generated when the code in your application changes, thus forcing the browser to download the new file.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: { 
        main: './src/index.js',
        another: './src/another-module.js'
    },
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: '[name].[contenthash].js'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: "babel-loader"
                }
            }
        ]
    }   
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We can use contenthash to create the hash in Webpack.</p>

    <p>If your main.js file is 400KB bundle, then each time this changes, our users have to download a new 400KB bundled file. This is where splitting our code maybe better, for example into main.js and vendor.js files.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/index.js'),
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: '[name].[contenthash].js'
    },
    optimization: {
        splitChunks: {
            chunks: 'all'
        }
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: "babel-loader"
                }
            }
        ]
    }   
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Webpack 4 makes an effor to do the best thing for you without you having to tell it exactly how you want to split your bundles.</p>

    <p>Adding optimization.splitChunks.chunks = 'all' (as above), is a way of saying "put everything you find in the node_modules directory into a file called vendors~main.js".</p>

    <p>With this basic bundle splitting in place, our Users will download a new 200KB main.js file on each visit if changes to the code occur, but only download the additional 200KB vendors.js bundle if we change the node_modules in some way. If this doesn't change, the vendors.js will not need to be downloaded, it will already have been cached (on repeat visits).</p>

    <p>Our vendors.js bundle will still suffer from the same problem our original main.js bundle file suffered from - a change to one part of it means having to re-download all parts of it. We can instead have a separate file for each NPM package.</p>

    <h2>path.join vs path.resolve</h2>
    <!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39110801/path-join-vs-path-resolve-with-dirname/39111164 -->

    <p>When creating a Webpack config file (webpack.config.js), you may come across path.join() and path.resolve(). Both look similar, but they have key differences. You will first need to require path in your Webpack config:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
path.join(__dirname, '/dist')
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>And here is the Webpack config file:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/index.js'),
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>You can see from the entry property that we are using path.resolve() in this example.</p>

    <p>For instance:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
path.join('app/libs/oauth', '/../ssl');
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Resolves to: app/libs/ssl</p>

    <p>path.resolve(), on the other hand, will resolve to an absolute path.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
path.resolve('bar', '/foo');
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Resolves to /foo since that is the first absolute path that can be constructed. However, if you run:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
path.resolve('/bar/bae', '/foo', 'test');
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The path returned will be /foo/test again because that is the first absolute path that can be formed from right to left.</p>

    <p>Using __dirname is the absolute path to the directory containing the source file. When you use path.resolve() or path.join(), they will return the same result if you give the same path following __dirname, so it reality, it doesn't matter it's just whichever one you prefer.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>The two methods deal with segments starting with / in very different ways. join will just concatenate it with the previous argument, resolve will treat this as the root directory and ignore all previous paths.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
path.join('/a', '/b');      // Outputs: '/a/b'

path.resolve('/a', '/b');   // Outputs: '/b'
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>path.resolve() will always result in an absolute URL and will use your working directory as a base to resolve the path. But as __dirname is an absolute path, it doesn't really matter.</p>

    <h2>Code Splitting</h2>

    <p>Code splitting is a feature that allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. It can be used to achieve smaller bundles and control resource load prioritisation which, if used correctly, can have a major impact on load time.</p>

    <p>So far, we've seen only a single entry point - src/index.js - and a single output bundle - dist/bundle.js. As your application grows, you'll need to split this up so that the entire codebase isn't downloaded at the start. A good approach is to use Code Splitting and Lazy Loading to fetch things on demand as the code paths require them.</p>

    <p>The Webpack config file will now be updated to implement code splitting. As an example, we will split another module - app.js - from the main bundle.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: { 
        main: './src/index.js',
        another: './src/another-module.js'
    },
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: '[name].bundle.js'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: "babel-loader"
                }
            }
        ]
    }   
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Webpack will now output two bundled files - main.bundle.js and another.bundle.js.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>

[./src/index.js] 85 bytes {main} [built]
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The External property within Webpack is used to exclude dependencies from the main bundle. If a package is also installed as a devDependency, it too won't go into the bundle.</p>

    <p>You may want to use a Bundle Analyser tool to check what your bundle contains once Webpack has worked its magic.</p>

    <h2>Source Maps</h2>

    <p>Since Webpack bundles the code, source maps are mandatory to get a reference to the original file that raised an error. For example, if you bundle three source files (a.js, b.js, and c.js) into one bundle (bundled.js) and one of these three source files contains an error, the stack trace will simply point to bundle.js. This is a problem if you want to know exactly if a.js, b.js, or c.js is causing the error.</p>

    <p>You can tell Webpack to generate source maps using the devtool property of the configuration.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    devtool: 'inline-source-map',
    // The rest of the config here
};
        </code>
    </pre> 

    <p>When we don't use a source map, we can open the browser development tools (Debugger tab), locate our JavaScript files (for our components) and the code displayed will be a mix of Webpack code and code for the component itself, which makes it really hard to debug if an issue occurs.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
__webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);
/* harmony import */ var react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ = __webpack_require__(/*! react */ "./node_modules/react/index.js");
/* harmony import */ var react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default = /*#__PURE__*/__webpack_require__.n(react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__);


var Button = function Button() {
  var renderButton = function renderButton() {
    return react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement("button", null, "Button");
  };

  return renderButton();
};

/* harmony default export */ __webpack_exports__["default"] = (Button);

//# sourceURL=webpack:///./src/js/components/1-atoms/button/Button.js?
        </code>
    </pre> 

    <p>If we use source mapping, our code to inspect and potentially debug, becomes much easier to understand:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
import React from 'react'

const Button = () => {
    const renderButton = () =>
        &lt;button&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;

    return (
        renderButton()
    )
}

export default Button
        </code>
    </pre> 

    <p>Although it will cause a slower build, it has no effect on production. Sourcemaps are only downloaded if you open the browser DevTools (Development Tools).</p>

    <h2>Setup ESLint</h2>

    <p>A Linter is a program that checks our code for any errors or warnings that can cause bugs. JavaScript's linter, ESLint, is a very flexible linting tool that can be configured in many ways.</p>

    <p>First, you will need to install ESLint using NPM (Node Package Manager):</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install eslint eslint-loader babel-eslint eslint-config-react eslint-plugin-react --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre> 

    <ul>
        <li>eslint is the core dependency for all functionalities while eslint-loader enables us to hook ESlint into Webpack. Since React uses ES6+ syntax, we will need to use babel-eslint also. This is a parser that enables eslint to lint all valid ES6+ code.</li>
        <li>eslint-config-react &amp; eslint-plugin-react are both used to enable ESLint to use pre-made rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will need to update our Webpack config file to make use of ESLint.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            use: ['babel-loader', 'eslint-loader']
        }]
    },
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>You will then need to create an eslint config file named .eslintrc with this content:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
    "parser": "babel-eslint",
    "extends": "react",
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "node": true
    },
    "settings": {
        "react": {
            "version": "detect"
        }
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This config is basically ensuring that ESLint is parsed using babel-eslint before it is checked and then also checking all the rules from our React config is passed. This will take global variables from the environment of browser and node, if it's React code, the version if taken from the module itself. That way the user doesn't have to specify the version manually.</p>

    <p>Rather than specifying our own rules manually, we simply extend react rules which were made available by eslint-config-react and eslint-plugin-react.</p>

    <p>If errors are found, you can look at the ESLint documentation for rules. You can also use the following command which can be added as a build script in the package.json file:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
"scripts": {
    "eslint-fix": "eslint --fix \"src/**/*.js\""
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Then when we run the build script any ESLint errors should be resolved.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm run eslint-fix
        </code>
    </pre>

    <!-- https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#stay-up-to-date -->
    <p>You may want to use the include field to only apply the loader modules that actually need to be transformed:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
module: {
    rules: [
        {
            test: /\.js$/,
            include: path.join(__dirname, 'src'),
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            use: {
                loader: 'babel-loader'
            }
        }
    ]
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Webpack Dev Server</h2>
    <!-- https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/ -->

    <p>webpack-dev-server can be used to quickly develop an application. It provides you with a simple web server and the ability to use live reloading.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>You can update package.json to have a build script that will run webpack-dev-server:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
"scripts": {
    "start:dev": "webpack-dev-server"
},
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This can be run using NPM (Node Package Manager):</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm run start:dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Within the webpack.config.js Webpack Config file, we can set the config for the webpack-dev-server:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './dist'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            use: ['babel-loader', 'eslint-loader']
        }]
    },
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>By default webpack-dev-server will be server over HTTP, but it can optionally be served over HTTP/2 with HTTPS:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './dist',
        https: true
    }
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Or, alternatively:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    devServer: {
        contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
        https: true
    }
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>You may need to add the HTML5 History API to webpack-dev-server when using React Router:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './dist',
        historyApiFallback: true,
        https: true
    }
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>If you want to enable Gzip compression for everything served:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './dist',
        historyApiFallback: true,
        https: true,
        compress: true
    }
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We can also set the port we want to use:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './dist',
        historyApiFallback: true,
        https: true,
        compress: true,
        port: 9000
    }
};
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Let's explain these properties in more detail.</p>

    <p>The historyApiFallback property tells webpack-dev-server to fallback to index.html in the event that a requested resource cannot be found.</p>

    <p>You can add an --open flag to your build script if you want webpack-dev-server to open up the browser when you run it.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
"scripts": {
    "start:dev": "webpack-dev-server --open"
},
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>You may also be able to add the --progress flag to your build script to show the progress/status of the bundle (percentage) has completed.</p>

    <p>If you hot reload the webpack-dev-server, this will enable Webpack's hot module replacement feature. This updates the browser every time you hit ctrl + s</p>
