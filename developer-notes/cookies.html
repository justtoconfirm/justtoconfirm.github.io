    <h1>Cookies</h1>

    <p>Cookies are small text files that are used to store up to 4KB of data, sent from a website and stored locally by the user's browser. Cookies are needed because HTTP is stateless. This means that HTTP itself has no way to keep track of a user's previous activities. Cookies allow a website to store information on a user's machine and later retrieve it. This data is stored in name-value pairs. For example, a website may generate a unique ID number for each visitor and store the ID number on the user's machine using a cookie.</p>

    <p>A "cookie" is more formally known as an HTTP cookie, a web cookie, an Internet cookie, or a browser cookie. A cookie consists of information. When you visit a website, the website sends the cookie to your computer. Your computer stores it in a file located inside your web browser.</p>

    <p>The purpose of the cookie is to help the website keep track of your visits and activity. For example, many online retailers use cookies to keep track of the items in a user's shopping cart as they explore the site. Without cookies, your shopping cart would reset to zero each time you clicked a new link on the site.</p>

    <p>A website may also use cookies to keep a record of your most recent visit or to record login information.</p>

    <p>Session cookies are used only when a person is actively navigating a website. Once you leave the site, the session cookie disappears. Tracking cookies maybe used to create long-term records of multiple visits to the same site. Authentication cookies track whether a user is logged in, and if so, under what name.</p>

    <p>The structure of a cookie is really simple. It's nothing more than several key-value pairs. A cookie can also have an optional expiration date, after which it'll be deleted. If no expiration date is provided, the cookie will last until the session or browser is closed.</p>

    <p>JavaScript can create, retrieve, and delete cookies using the document.cookie property. This property will return all cookies in one string, much like: cookie1=value; cookie2=value</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
document.cookie
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Creating a Cookie</h2>

    <p>JavaScript can create, read, and delete cookies with the document.cookie property. The example below shows how to create a Cookie using JavaScript. No expiration date has been provided, and by default, the cookie belongs to the current page.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
document.cookie = "username=John Smith";
    
// Setting the cookie to expire
document.cookie = "username=John Smith; expires=Tue, 15 Jan 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Here is a JavaScript function to create a cookie:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
function createCookie(name, value, days) {
    if (days) {
        var date = new Date();
        date.setTime(date.getTime()+(days*24*60*60*1000));
        var expires = "; expires="+date.toGMTString();
    }
    else var expires = "";
    document.cookie = name+"="+value+expires+"; path=/";
}
    
// Create a cookie with no expiration
createCookie('userid', '1234567890');
    
// Create a cookie that expires in 21 days
createCookie('username', 'John Smith', 21);
        </code>
    </pre>
</main>
