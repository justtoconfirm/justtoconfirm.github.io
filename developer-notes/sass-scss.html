    <h1>Sass &amp; SCSS</h1>

    <p>Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a style sheet language initially developer by Hampton Catlin and Natalie Weizenbaum. In short, Sass is a CSS preprocessor which adds new features such as variables, nested rules, and mixins. These features can be considered as syntactic sugar, added into the regular CSS.</p>

    <p>SCSS (Sassy CSS) was introduced in Sass 3, is a superset - contains all the features of CSS, but expanded to include the features of Sass as well - of the CSS3 syntax. This means that every valid CSS3 stylesheet is valid SCSS. SCSS files use the extension .scss the second, older syntax (Sass), uses indented syntax.</p>

    <p>The indented syntax of Sass was inherited from Haml. When SCSS (Sassy CSS) syntax was introduced in Sass 3, it became the "new main syntax" for Sass and builds on the existing syntax of CSS.</p>

    <h3>Ruby Sass &amp; LibSass</h3>

    <p>Both Ruby Sass and LibSass are similar, the main differences are in the implementation, compiling speed, and feature support.</p>

    <p>The original Sass is written in Ruby. With Ruby Sass, as long as you're running Ruby, you install Sass, run the compiler and that's it. This is likely to be the default Sass setup.</p>

    <p>LibSass is a C/C++ post of the original Sass engine. It doesn't rely on Ruby to generate CSS so it can be implemented in other languages.</p>

    <p>For instance, if a project is running node-sass, LibSass is the core library, node-sass is the wrapper that allows compiling inside of Node.js</p>

    <p>With LibSass you're no longer bound to a Ruby dependency, with may wrappers available, it's now easy to integrate Sass with almost any language.</p>

    <p>LibSass runs and compiles style sheets significantly faster than Ruby Sass. Ruby Sass is ahead of LibSass, however, when new features are introduced.</p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>Variables are a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here is an example:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
    font: 100% $font-stack;
    background-color: $primary-color;
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our variable values placed in the CSS.</p>

    <h2>Partials</h2>

    <p>You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. A partial is simply a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss with the underscore letting Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// partials/_color.scss

$primary-color: #333;

.element {
    background-color: $primary-color;
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Sass partials are used/included with the @import directive. When importing the partial, we do not include the underscore and remove the .scss file extension.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// main.scss

@import 'partials/color';
@import 'partials/second-partial';  // Another SCSS partial
        </code>
    </pre>
</main>
