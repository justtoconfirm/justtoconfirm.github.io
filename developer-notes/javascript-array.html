    <h1>JavaScript Array</h1>

    <p>In JavaScript, the array data type consists of a list of elements. There are many useful built-in methods available for developers to work with arrays. Methods that modify the original array are known as mutator methods and methods that return a new value or representation are known as accessor methods. A third class of array methods, known as iteration methods, which are methods that operate on every item in an array, one at a time, also exist. These methods are closely associated with loops.</p>

    <p>Array methods are properly written out as Array.prototype.method(), as Array.prototype refers to the Array object itself.</p>

    <p>We will use the following Array for all of our examples:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
var fish = [ "piranha", "barracuda", "cod", "eel" ];
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Iteration Methods</h2>

    <p>Our examples may use the arrow function syntax.</p>

    <h3>forEach()</h3>

    <p>The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
fish.forEach(individualFish => {
   console.log(individualFish); 
});
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once we call this function, we'll receive the following output:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
piranha
barracuda
cod
eel
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Another way to do this is using the for loop and testing it against the length property of the array.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// Loop through the length of the array
for (var i = 0; i < fish.length; i++) {
    console.log(fish[i]);
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>filter()</h3>

    <p>The filter() method creates a new array with the elements that pass the result of a given test. We could use filter() to return a new array containing only the items in a list that start with a specific letter. We can utilize string indexing to call the first item (or letter) in each string item of the array.</p>

    <p>We are testing which items in the array have a "p" at the 0 index (the first letter), and assigned the result into a new variable. filter() is an iteration method and does not mutate the original array.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// Filter all fish that start with "p" into a new list
var filteredList = fish.filter(creature => {
   return creature[0] === "p"; 
});

filteredList;       // ["piranha"]
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>find()</h3>

    <p>The find() method returns the first value in an array that passed a given test.</p>

    <p>As an example, we will create an array of cars. We will then use the find() method to test if any of the cars in the array are from Germany.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
var cars = [ "Volvo", "Vauxhall", "BMW", "Fiat", "Audi", "Mercedes-Benz" ];

// Check if a given value is a German car
const isGerman = german => {
    return [ "Mercedes-Benz", "Audi", "BMW" ].includes(german);
}

cars.find(isGerman);        // "BMW"
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Since "BMW" was the first entry in the array to satisfy the test in the isGerman() function, it is the first value to be returned.</p>

    <h3>findIndex()</h3>

    <p>The findIndex() method returns the first index in an array that passes given test.</p>

    <p>We can use the same code as before, but find the index number instead of the value of the first match. If the test is not satisfied, findIndex() will return -1.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
cars.findIndex(isGerman);       // 2
        </code>
    </pre>
</main>
