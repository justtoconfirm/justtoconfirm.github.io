    <h2>CRM - Customer Relationship Management</h2>

    <p>A CRM system helps businesses keep customer contact details up to date, track customer interactions, and manage customer accounts. It is also a strategy that companies use to manage interactions with customers and potential customers. Salesforce is an example of a cloud-based CRM platform.</p>

    <h2>The Cloud</h2>

    <p>Information and data stored on physical or virtual servers which are maintained and controlled by a cloud computing provider, such as Amazon and their Amazon Web Services (AWS) product. As a personal or business user, you can access your stored information on the 'cloud' via an Internet connection. AWS is a secure cloud services platform offering computing power, database storage, content delivery, and other functionality. Azure is another example of cloud services provided by Microsoft as is the Google Cloud platform.</p>
