    <h1>JavaScript: Objects</h1>

    <p>An object in JavaScript is a data type composed of a collection of names/keys and values. These names/keys and value pairs can consist of properties that may contain any data type - including strings, numbers, and Booleans - as well as methods.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>Methods are functions contained within an object.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Objects in JavaScript are standalone entities that can be likened to objects in real life. For example, a book may be an object which you would describe by the title, author, number or pages, and genre. A car might be an object you would describe by the colour, make, model and horsepower.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>JavaScript <a href="javascript-array.html">arrays</a> are also a type of object.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Objects are an integral and foundational aspect of most JavaScript programs. A common use case is a shopping cart that could consist of an array of many objects containing information for each item, such as name, price, and quantity. A to-do list is another example as is a user account object that may contain such data as usernames, passwords, and e-mail addresses.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>An object is a JavaScript data type, just as a number or string is also a data type. As a data type, an object can be contained within a variable.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are two ways to construct an object in JavaScript:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The object literal, which uses curly brackets: {}</li>
        <li>The object constructor, which uses the new keyword</li>
    </ul>

    <p>First, the object literal.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// Initialize object literal with curly brackets
const objectLiteral = {}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In this next example, we'll use the object constructor.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// Initialize object constructor with the new Object
const objectConstructor = new Object()
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Both of these approaches will create an empty object.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>You may notice the this keyword being used. When using this inside of an object, it refers to the current object.</p>
    </div>
