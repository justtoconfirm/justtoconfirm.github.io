    <h1>Sass &amp; SCSS</h1>

    <p>The new main syntax (as of Sass 3) is known as SCSS (or "Sassy CSS") and is a superset of the CSS3 syntax. This means that every valid CSS3 stylesheet is valid SCSS also. The second, older syntax, is known as the indented syntax. This is named Sass.</p>

    <p>Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum.</p>

    <p>Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance. A proprocessor will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can then use in your website.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>SCSS files use the file extension of .scss</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Ruby Sass vs LibSass</h2>

    <p>The original version of Sass was written in Ruby. With Ruby Sass, you install Sass, run the compiler and your files will be compiled into CSS. Ruby Sass will not work if your development environment is outside of Ruby and if a project is large, the Ruby Sass engine can take a bit of time to compile to CSS.</p>

    <p>LibSass is a C/C++ port of the original Sass engine that doesn't rely on Ruby to generate CSS, so it can be implemented in other languages.</p>

    <p>By itself, LibSass doesn't do anything, it's just a library. For LibSass to work, you'll need a wrapper (or implementor) around LibSass to run the library and compile your style sheets. Some of the most common LibSass wrappers are node-sass, grunt-sass and even a Ruby wrapper is available.</p>

    <p>If your project is using node-sass, LibSass is the core library and node-sass is the wrapper that allows compiling inside of Node.</p>

    <p>LibSass has the advantage of increased compiling speed and is much faster than Ruby Sass.</p>

    <p>LibSass is slightly behind the development curve compared to Ruby Sass, however, when it comes to certain features. For a list of the inconsistencies between LibSass and Ruby Sass, visit <a href="http://sass-compatibility.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://sass-compatibility.github.io/</a></p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>Ruby Sass will not release any new features until LibSass catches up. Once this occurs, there will be feature parity between the two moving forward.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Install</h2>

    <p>Sass can be installed on Windows, Mac, or Linux using NPM (Node Package Manager). This will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass which runs slower than other options of Sass and will be installed globally on your machine.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install sass -g
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Alternatively, you can install node-sass. A library that provides binding for Node to LibSass, the C version of Sass. This allows you to natively compile .scss files to .css</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>It's best to install node-sass as a devDependency within your project. This will be listed within your package.json file.</p>
    </div>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm install node-sass --save-dev
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The NPM documentation for node-sass can be found at: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass</a></p>

    <p>Within your package.json file, create a script that will compile your SCSS into CSS.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>The script below will compile the SCSS file named main.scss within the src/styles directory and output a CSS stylesheet named style.css within the dist/styles directory.</p>
    </div>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
    "compile:scss": "node-sass --include-path scss src/styles/main.scss dist/styles/style.css",
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This script can be run from within your terminal.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ npm run compile:scss
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>

    <h3>Partials</h3>

    <p>You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that can then be included in other Sass files. This is useful to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain.</p>

    <p>A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You may name it something like _partial.scss with the underscore used to let Sass know that the file is only a partial file and it should not be generated into a CSS file.</p>

    <p>We have previously used the @import rule to use a partial, however this is being replaced by the @use rule.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>The Sass team discourages the continued use of the @import rule. Sass will gradually phase it out over the next few years and eventually remove it from the language entirely. Prefer the @use rule instead.</p>
    </div>
