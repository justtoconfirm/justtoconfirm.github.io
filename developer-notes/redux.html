    <h1>Redux</h1>

    <h2>Install Redux</h2>

    <p>To install Redux, to be used with React, use NPM (Node Package Manager) to install as a dependency. You will also need to install the react-redux package to allow Redux to work with React.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
$ <span class="token-keyword">npm</span> install redux --save
$ <span class="token-keyword">npm</span> install react-redux --save
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>What is State&#63;</h2>

    <p>At the heart of every React component is its 'state', an object that determines how that component should render and behave. The state is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive. Using Redux allows the state to be within the store and not within individual React components.</p> 

    <p>In nature, the state of water can change based on the temperature value changing. If water is placed in a freezer the temperature value will decrease and the state of water will be solid. If the temperature increases, the state will change to being a gas. This is a simplified example of what we mean when we refer to state.</p>

    <h2>File Structure</h2>

    <p>When setting up Redux within a React project, we will create a number of directories for our Redux code within our application 'src' directory. This is how the file structure will look:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
src /
    actions /
    constants/
        action-types.js
    reducers /
        index.js
        reducer-one.js
        reducer-two.js
    store /
        index.js
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Store</h2>

    <p>The state of the whole application lives inside the store. To create the store, we use the createStore() function. We must first import createStore() from the Redux library. It is often recommended to place the store in its own directory within your application. Here we find the initial store that has been created:</p> 

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// src/store/index.js</span>

<span class="token-keyword">import</span> { createStore } from 'redux';

<span class="token-keyword">const</span> store = createStore();

<span class="token-keyword">export</span> default store;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Connect Redux &amp; React</h2>

    <p>To connect Redux with React, we're going to use the Provider high order component that comes with the react-redux library. This wraps up your React application and makes the application and all its components aware of the Redux store. React uses the store for accessing the state and to dispatch actions.</p>

    <p>Within your React application, you will likely have a main JavaScript file. For the purpose of this example, our file will be called 'index.js'. We are going to use the Provider component to connect to the store.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// src/index.js</span>

<span class="token-keyword">import</span> React from 'react';
<span class="token-keyword">import</span> ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
<span class="token-keyword">import</span> { Provider } from 'react-redux';
<span class="token-keyword">import</span> store from './store/index';
<span class="token-keyword">import</span> App from './components/App';

ReactDOM.render (
    &lt;<span class="token-tag">Provider</span> store={store}&gt;
        &lt;<span class="token-tag">App</span> /&gt;,
    &lt;<span class="token-tag">/Provider</span>&gt;,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Reducers</h2>

    <p>Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. A reducer is simply a JavaScript function that takes two parameters, the current state and the action.</p>

    <p>In Redux, the logic for state changes is done using Reducers. Simply put, the reducer returns a completely new state that substitutes the previous one, as this example shows:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
(currentState, action) => newState;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The example below shows a super simple reducer. This file has been saved within a new directory created named 'reducers'.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// src/reducers/index.js</span>

<span class="token-keyword">const</span> rootReducer = (state, action) => state;

<span class="token-keyword">export</span> default rootReducer;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In the example above, we are creating a simple function, the Reducer in this example is written using ES6 syntax and includes the parameters of 'state' and 'action'. This is then returning the state and the reducer is then exported. If we were to write this using ES5 syntax, it would look something like this:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// src/reducers/index.js</span>

<span class="token-keyword">function</span> rootReducer(state, action) {
    
    <span class="token-punctuation">// Do stuff here</span>
    
    return state;
};

<span class="token-keyword">export</span> default rootReducer;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Our current reducer does nothing. In this updated code, we shall return the initial state without doing anything further.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// src/reducers/index.js</span>

<span class="token-keyword">const</span> initialState = {
    <span class="token-punctuation">// Code not added</span>
}

<span class="token-keyword">const</span> rootReducer = (state = initialState, action) => state;

<span class="token-keyword">export</span> default rootReducer;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We can then update the store to include the reducer and get the initial state.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// src/store/index.js</span>

<span class="token-keyword">import</span> { createStore } from 'redux';
<span class="token-keyword">import</span> rootReducer from '../reducers/index';

<span class="token-keyword">const</span> store = createStore(rootReducer);

<span class="token-keyword">export</span> default store;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Combine Multiple Reducers</h3>

    <p>As your application grows and becomes more complex, you'll want to split your reducer functions into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state. The combineReducers() helper function included within the Redux library can be used to do this. Splitting your reducers into separate functions using the combineReducers() helper function is a good practice to follow.</p>

    <p>Let's imagine that we have created two reducers. We must have a rootReducer that is a combination of all the reducers of our application. We can update our 'index.js' file within our 'reducers' directory to apply the combineReducers() helper function from the Redux library. This will first need to be imported.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// src/reducers/index.js</span>

import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import oneReducer from './reducer-one';
import twoReducer from './reducer-two';

<span class="token-keyword">const</span> rootReducer = combineReducers({
    ones: oneReducer,
    twos: twoReducer
});

<span class="token-keyword">export</span> default rootReducer;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>And here are the two example reducers that are being used:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// src/reducers/reducer-one.js</span>

<span class="token-keyword">const</span> oneReducer = (state, action) => state;

<span class="token-keyword">export</span> default oneReducer;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
<span class="token-punctuation">// src/reducers/reducer-two.js</span>

<span class="token-keyword">const</span> twoReducer = (state, action) => state;

<span class="token-keyword">export</span> default twoReducer;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Actions</h2>

    <p>Actions are plain JavaScript objects. They are the payloads (messages) of information that we send (i.e. dispatch) from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for our central Redux store.</p> 

    <p>You send actions to the Redux store using store.dispatch().</p>

    <p>Within our React application, we have created an 'actions' directory for our actions.</p>

    <p>Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed. The type property is a string that simply describes the type of an action.</p>

    <p>in Redux, we know that actions are plain objects just like this one:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
{
    type: 'ADD_TODO'
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>An action usually represents some kind of event - like the beginning of an API call, or a user logging in.</p>

    <h3>Action creators</h3>

    <p>When an action is wrapped within a function, is is referred to as an action creator (a function that creates actions). This is a plain function that returns the action object. If an action is extremely simple - just a type property and nothing more - it may not be worth using an action creator. If the action increases in complexity, then it maybe suitable to use. The benefit of using an action creator is that it allows the action to be reused simply and easily.</p>

    <p>Action creators makes actions portable and easy to test.</p>

    <p>Examples of simple action creators, in both ES5 and ES6 syntax, can be found below:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// ES5 syntax
function userLoggedIn() {
    return {
        type: 'ADD_TODO'
    };
}

// ES6 syntax
const userLoggedIn = () => ({
    type: 'ADD_TODO'
})
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>String constants</h3>

    <p>Types should typically be defined as string constants. Once your application is large enough, you may want to move them into a separate module. Begin by creating a 'constants' directory within the 'src' directory of your application. Within this directory, create a file named 'action-types.js'. This is where we will define our string constants. As an example, we will create a string constant for 'ADD_TODO'. We use the 'export' keyword as we want to export the string constant elsewhere within our application.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
// src/constants/action-types.js

export const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Now, within our actions file, we can import the string constant we have just created. You will need to remove the 'ADD_TODO' string value from the type property within the action also. The actions will be placed within the 'action' directory of our application. Here is an example of how a basic action should now look:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
import { ADD_TODO } from '../constants/action-types';

// No action creator function needed

{
    type: ADD_TODO
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Other than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you.</p>
