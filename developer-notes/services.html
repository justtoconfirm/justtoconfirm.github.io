    <h1>Services &amp; Microservices</h1>

    <p>A web service is a function that can be accessed by other programs over the web (HTTP). A service is not targeted at humans, but rather at other programs. For example, a PHP website that generates a random integer could be a web service if it outputs the integer in a format that maybe consumed by another program. It simply allows a program to talk to a web page instead of using your browser to open a web page.</p>

    <p>Microservice architecture, or simply microservices, is a method of developing software systems that tries to focus on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces. Applications have traditionally been monolithic, becoming problematic as applications get larger and more complex. A microservice architecture is structured as a collection of loosely coupled services. This makes the application easier to build, maintain, and scale.</p>

    <p>In short, a microservice architecture is a term used to describe the practice of breaking up an application into a series of smaller, more specialised parts, each of which communicate with one another across common interfaces, such as APIs and REST interfaces like HTTP.</p>

    <p>A Web service facilitates interaction between two machines over a network. An API acts as an interface between two different applications so they can communicate with each other.</p>

    <p>When we say we "consume" a web service, this means that the service successfully fulfulls the web client's request.</p>

    <p>Python for example, can be used to create Web APIs so you can serve it as a RESTful web service, using a tool such as Flask. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.</p>

    <p>REST APIs are pretty much everywhere. They are the standard method to expose databases to clients.</p>

    <p>The most popular programming languages for services and microservices are: Java, C#, C, Ruby, Python, and C++</p>
