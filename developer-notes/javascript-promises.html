    <h1>JavaScript Promises</h1>

    <p>JavaScript is single threaded, meaning that two bits of script cannot run at the same time; they have to run one after another (only do one thing at a time). In browsers, JavaScript shares a thread with many other things that differ from browser to browser. For this reason, JavaScript is a synchronous language.</p>

    <p>While synchronous code is easier to follow and debug, async is generally better for performance and flexibility. Why "hold up the show" when you can trigger numerous requests at once and then handle them when each is ready.</p>

    <p>The XMLHttpRequest API is async, but does not use the Promises API. The Fecth API, however, does use promises as does the ServiceWorker API.</p>

    <p>A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. It is a placeholder into which the successful result value or reason for failure will materialise.</p>

    <p>Promises provide a simpler alternative for executing, composing, and managing asynchronous operations compared to traditional callback-based approaches. They also allow you to handle asynchronous errors using approaches that are similar to synchronous try/catch.</p>

    <p>In other words, a promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future. This value is either resolved, or not resolved (for example, due to a network failure). Here is a simple example:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
let test = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    () => {
        console.log('yay!')
    }
})

typeof test
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>A promise is just a plain old object.</p>

    <p>A promise may be in one of three possible states:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fulfilled</li>
        <li>Rejected</li>
        <li>Pending</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A promise is settled if it's not pending (it has been resolved or rejected). When a promise is pending, it can transition to the fulfilled or rejected state. Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, however, it will never transition to any other state and its value or failure reason will not change.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, promises don't solve what is called "callback hell", which in reality, is just a series of nested function calls.</p>

    <h2>Creating a Promise</h2>

    <p>A promise object is created using the new keyword and its constructor. This constructor takes as its argument, a function, called the "executor function". This function should take two functions as parameters, resolve and reject.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
const myFirstPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    
});
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We can extend this simple example further:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
const myFirstPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(function() {
        resolve("Success!");        // Yay! Everything went well!
    }, 250);
});

myFirstPromise.then((successMessage) => {
    console.log("Yay! " + successMessage);
});
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We call resolve() when what we were doing asynchronously was successful, and reject when it failed. In this example, we use setTimeout() to simulate async code. In reality, you will probably be using something like XHR or an HTML5 API. successMessage is whatever we passed in the resolve parameter. It doesn't have to be a string, but if it's only a succeed message, it probably will be.</p>

    <p>To provide a function with promise functionality, simply have it return a promise:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
function myAsyncFunction(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open("GET", url);
        xhr.onload = () => resolve(xhr.responseText);
        xhr.onerror = () => reject(xhr.statusText);
        xhr.send();
    });
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Here is a function that returns a promise which will resolve after a specified time delay:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
const wait = time => new Promise((resolve)) => setTimeout(resolve, time));

wait(3000).then(() => console.log('Hello!'));   // 'Hello!'
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Our wait(3000) call will wait 3000ms (3 seconds) and then logs 'Hello!'. A .then() method is defined which you use to pass handlers which can take the resolved or rejected value.</p>

    <p>The ES6 promise constructor takes a function. That function takes two parameters, resolve and reject. In the example above, we're only using resolve as a parameter. We are then calling the setTimeout() method to create the delay which calles resolve() when it's finished.</p>
