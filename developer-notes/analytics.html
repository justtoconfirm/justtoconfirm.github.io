    <h1>Analytics</h1>

    <h2>What is Analytics&#63;</h2>

    <p>Web analytics is the collection, reporting, and analysis of website data. The focus is on identifying measures based on your organisational and user goals and using the data to determine the success or failure of those goals. This helps to drive strategy and improve the user experience.</p>

    <h2>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)</h2>

    <p>Conversion rate optimization (CRO) is the systematic process of increasing the percentage of website visitors who take a desired action, be that filling out out form, becoming customers, or otherwise. The CRO process involves understanding how users move through your site, what actions they take, or what's stopping them from completing your goals.</p>

    <p>In Internet marketing, Conversion Optimization, or Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is a system for increasing the percentage of visitors to a website that convert into customers, or more generally, take a desired action on a webpage.</p>

    <p>A conversion is a general term for a visitor completing a site goal. Goals come in many shapes and sizes. If you use a website to sell products, the primary goal (macro-conversion) is for the user to make a purchase. There are smaller conversions that can happen before a user completes a macro-conversion such as signing up to receive emails. These are called micro-conversions.</p>

    <p>Examples of conversions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Purchasing a product from the site</li>
        <li>Requesting a quote</li>
        <li>Subscribing to a service</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your site's conversion rate is the number of times a user completes a goal divided by your site traffic.</p>

    <h2>Omniture</h2>

    <p>Omniture is an online marketing and web analytics business. It was acquired by Adobe Systems in 2009.</p>

    <h2>Website Optimization</h2>

    <p>Website optimization involves improving the aspects of your website that contribute to traffic and conversions. Traffic comes from SEO, paid search, paid social, organic social/search, and other sources. Conversions come from good marketing.</p>

    <p>Specifically, you want to optimize your site for your specific audience. Website optimization tools help you figure out what you're doing wrong, and what you're doing right.</p>

    <p>Tools you can use:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>GTmetrix - page load speed will impact your search engine rankings. Slow page load speeds will contribute to high bounce rates. Users will not wait for slow pages to load. This is an optimisation tol that can help to determine this.</li>
        <li>Google Search Console - Analyzes your website and helps you imrpove it to rank it better in search results to boost conversions. Add a "property" to Google Search Console and verify it on your website by installing a code, a brief snippet of HTML.</li>
        <li>Yoast SEO - Plugin for WordPress websites. Everytime you create a new post or page, Yoast will give you an SEO and readability score.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Time to First Byte (TTFB)</h2>

    <p>Time to first byte (TTFB) is a measurement used as an indication of the responsiveness of a webserver or other network resources. TTFB measures the duration from the user or client making an HTTP request to the first byte of the page being received by the client's browser.</p>

    <h2>Bounce Rate</h2>

    <p>The percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page.</p>

    <h2>Performance Budget</h2>

    <p>If you're building a web experience and want to stay fast, a performance budget can be critical. A performance budget is a limit for pages which the team are not allowed to exceed. This could be a maximum JavaScript bundle size, total image weight, specific load time (e.g. Time-to-Interactive in under 5s on 3G/4G) or threshold on any number of other metrics.</p>

    <p>Quantity-based metrics can be used based on raw values, such as weight of the JavaScript (KB/MB), number of HTTP requests. These are focused on the browser experience.</p>

    <p>Rule-based metrics scores are generated by tools such as Lighthouse or WebPageTest. Often a single number of series to grade your site. Tools such as SpeedCurve could be used.</p>

    <p>Examples of budgets:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Our product page must ship with less than 170KB of JavaScript on mobile.</li>
        <li>Our search page must include less than 2MB of images on desktop.</li>
        <li>Our home page must load and get interactive in < 5s on slow 3G/Moto G4</li>
        <li>Our blog must score > 80 on Lighthouse performance audits.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>How to stay under budget:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Optimize existing features</li>
        <li>Remove existing features</li>
        <li>Do not add new features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adobe Test &amp; Target</h2>

    <p>Adobe Test &amp; Target is a robust website optimization tool. The tool allows you to design tests and create audience segments to target content. Test &amp; Target provides its own reporting interface to analyze the results of a test.</p>

    <h2>Google Analytics</h2>

    <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google and launched in November 2005, that tracks and reports website traffic. This is currently a platform inside the Google Marketing Platform brand.</p>

    <h2>Google Tag Manager (GTM)</h2>

    <p>Google Tag Manager (GTM) allows you to manage your tags without editing your code. GTM gives you the ability to add and update your own tags for conversion tracking, site analytics, and more.</p>

    <p>Tracking pixels are little bits of code that collect information about your website users. These pixels are often referred to as "tags". GTM allows you to manage all your tracking tags in one place and install tags without manually editing your website code.</p>

    <p>Tracking code can also cause problems in the area of web development. Typically web developers are tasked with adding new tracking tags to a website. Installing tracking codes can be tedious and problematic. new tracking scrips have to be tested and verified. Tracking codes are also notorious for breaking websites.</p>

    <p>Tag templates are ready-made tracking scripts with minimal input needed. They are optimised for speed, cross-browser compatibility, and are verified by Google. You can install these templates without touching any code. Most of them can be connected to your website by simply inputting vendor genrated tracking IDs - such as Twitter pixel ID, or Google Analytics ID. When vendors update their tracking code, your template will automatically update with little maintenence work required. There are over 90 tag templates available in GTM.</p>

    <p>The only major marketing platform that doesn't have a GTM template is Facebook.</p>

    <p>If your website is fairly simple and perhaps using Google Analytics tracking code, you probably don't need GTM. If you only have one tracking tag, again, you don't need tag manager.</p>

    <p>In GTM we use tags (also known as analytics or marketing scripts) that use triggers (known as rules), to activate your tracking tags. We can use variables, also known as macros.</p>

    <h3>GTM - Tag Templates</h3>

    <p>Tag templates in GTM replace the JavaScript code snippets you otherwise add to your site manually. Each tag template requires input to locate the system you're connecting with your tags. For example, to use the Google Analytics template, you need to input your property Tracking ID.</p>

    <p>Each tag template provided in GTM has a unique input that connects it with your account on the corresponding vendor's platform. For tag templates, you usually only need to put in one unique value and set a trigger. This means that you don't have to edit or adjust the tracking code within your tags. Tags templates do most of the hard work for you, but you still need to set up triggers to make your tracking tags work.</p>

    <h3>Triggers in GTM</h3>

    <p>A trigger is a set of rules that tells your tag when to start firing. The most basic trigger in GTM is the all pages trigger. This tells your tag to fire on every page when the page loads. This trigger is typically used with the Google Analytics tag.</p>

    <p>GTM has triggers for scroll depth, button clicks, custom events, and more.</p>

    <h3>Variables in GTM</h3>

    <p>Following tags and triggers, the third part of GTM is variables. Variables are what make the values you track dynamic. Variables are critical if you want to scale your tag management.</p>

    <h2>A/B Testing</h2>

    <p>A/B testing (sometimes called split testing) is used to compare two versions of a web page to see which one performs better. You compare two web pages by showing the two varients (often called 'A' and 'B'), to similar visitors are the same time. The one that gives a better conversion rate wins.</p>

    <p>Every business website wants visitors converting from just visitors to something else. The rate at which a website is able to do this is its "conversion rate". Measuring the performance of variation (A or B) means measuring the rate at which it converts visitors to goal achievers.</p>

    <h2>Mixpanel</h2>

    <p>Mixpanel is a business analytics service company. It tracks user interactions with web and mobile applications, and provides tools for targeted communication with them. It's toolset contains in-app A/B tests and user survey forms. Data collected is used to build custom reports and measure user engagement and retention.</p>

    <h2>Hotjar</h2>

    <p>Hotjar is a powerful tool that reveals online behavior of users. It combines Analysis and Feedback tools and gives you the 'big picture' of how to improve your site's user experience and performance/conversion rates.</p>

    <p>The Hotjar tracking code is a code snippet that needs to be installed on your site for you to be able to use Hotjar. Amongst other things, it allows you to record visitors and collect heatmap data.</p>

    <p>Documentation provided by Hotjar suggests that the tracking code should be placed anywhere between &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt;.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
<!-- leave this line empty -->
&lt;!-- Hotjar Tracking Code --&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
(function(h,o,t,j,a,r){
    h.hj=h.hj||function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q||[]).push(arguments)};
    h._hjSettings={hjid:123456,hjsv:5};
    a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
    r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1;
    r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv;
    a.appendChild(r);
})(window,document,'//static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv=');
&lt;/script&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>When you add a new site, each site gets its own unique Hotjar tracking code, which you simply install on the site it corresponds to.</p>
