		<h1>WordPress</h1>

		<p>WordPress is a free and open-source <span class="hl">Content Management System (CMS)</span> based on <span class="hl">PHP</span> and <span class="hl">MySQL</span>. WordPress was released on <strong>May 27, 2003</strong> by <strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> and <strong>Mike Little</strong>.</p>

		<h2>Install</h2>

		<p>To install WordPress locally you will need <strong>MAMP</strong> (Mac) or <strong>WAMP/XAMPP</strong> (Windows or other), installed also. This will allow you to have <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong> and an <strong>Apache</strong> server available.</p>

		<p>Next, go to <a href="https://wordpress.org/" class="link">https://wordpress.org/</a> to download the latest version of WordPress. This will be in the form of a <span class="hl">.zip</span> file which will need to be extracted.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The folder will be named <span class="hl">wordpress</span> once downloaded, but feel free to rename it to something else if you wish.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Once WordPress has downloaded, locate the folder where MAMP/WAMP or XAMPP has been installed. Within this directory/folder should be a <span class="hl">htdocs</span> folder. This is where we want to place our downloaded WordPress folder/directory. For the purpose of our examples, we will be renaming our WordPress directory/folder as <span class="hl">wp-project</span>.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In the MAMP/WAMP or XAMPP control panel, you will need to start the <strong>Apache server</strong> and <strong>MySQL database</strong>.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>To begin the setup, start MAMP/WAMP or XAMPP, open a browser and point the URL to: <span class="hl">http://localhost/wp-project</span></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p><span class="hl">wp-project</span> is the name of our WordPress project - in this example.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>This will open the <span class="hl">wp-admin/setup-config.php</span> page. Select the language and click the <span class="hl">Continue</span> button.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-setup-one.png" alt="WordPress setup screen" />

		<p>Next, follow the instructions as we will now be setting up the database configuration in the <span class="hl">wp-config.php</span> file. Click the <span class="hl">Let's go!</span> button to continue.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-setup-two.png" alt="WordPress setup screen" />

		<p>You will need to create a database in the MySQL database so we can setup our WordPress installation. To do this, you can use <span class="hl">PHPMyAdmin</span>. Open a browser tab/window and enter the URL: <span class="hl">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</span>.</p>

		<p>Click on the <span class="hl">Databases</span> tab/link and enter the name of the database you want to create in the input field. For our example project, the database is to be named <span class="hl">wp-project</span>.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-database-setup.png" alt="Database setup in PHPMyAdmin" />

		<p>Click the <span class="hl">Create</span> button.</p>

		<p>The database connection details need to now be entered. Once entered, click the <span class="hl">Submit</span> button.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Unless changed, the default MAMP/WAMP or XAMPP <strong>Username</strong> is: <span class="hl">root</span> and the <strong>Password</strong> remains <strong>empty</strong> with no input. The <strong>database host</strong> should be <span class="hl">localhost</span>. The <strong>Database Name</strong> can be changed to what you would like, and the <strong>Table Prefix</strong> field can also be changed, but we will keep it as <span class="hl">wp_</span> for now (unless you have multiple WordPress installations, then you may want to change it for each one).</p>
		</blockquote>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-setup-three.png" alt="WordPress setup screen" />

		<p>The database setup should now be complete. If an issues occur with the connection, close the browser and follow the setup steps once again. Click the <span class="hl">Run the install</span> button.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-setup-four.png" alt="WordPress setup screen" />

		<p>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Click the <span class="hl">Install WordPress</span> button to complete the installation.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-setup-five.png" alt="WordPress setup screen" />

		<blockquote>
			<p>Remember you can change the <strong>Password</strong> and <strong>Username</strong> fields to something more simple should you want to test locally, but this is not recommended for production when security is a key concern. For our example project, the <strong>Username</strong> is: <span class="hl">username</span> and the <strong>Password</strong> is: <span class="hl">password</span></p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>The installation is a success. Click the <span class="hl">Log In</span> button to log in with your <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong>.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-setup-six.png" alt="WordPress setup screen" />

		<p>The <strong>login</strong> screen:</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-login.png" alt="WordPress login screen" />

		<p>Once logged in, you will see the WordPress <strong>dashboard</strong>.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-dashboard.png" alt="Wordpress dashboard" />

		<blockquote>
			<p>When WordPress is installed, any configuration settings (such as database settings), can be found within the <span class="hl">wp-config.php</span> file.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>Login to WordPress</h2>

		<p>To login to WordPress, open the browser and point the URL to: <span class="hl">http://localhost/wp-project/wp-admin</span>. Enter your <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> to complete the login process.</p>

		<p>This will now display the <span class="hl">dashboard</span>.</p>

		<h2>Create a page</h2>

		<p>In WordPress, you can put content on your site as either a <span class="hl">post</span> or a <span class="hl">page</span>. Posts are usually for content you want to display in reverse chronological order. In contrast, pages are for content such as <strong>About</strong> or <strong>Contact</strong> pages. Pages are usually used to present timeless information about yourself or your site.</p>

		<p>To create a new page, login to the WordPress dashboard and navigate to <span class="hl">Pages / Add New</span></p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-add-page.png" alt="Add new page option on the WordPress dashboard" />

		<p>On the <span class="hl">Add New Page</span> page, enter a title in the first input field followed by text you wish to appear on the page itself as copy in the larger textarea below. For this example, we will create a simple <span class="hl">About</span> page.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-about-page.png" alt="About page on the WordPress dashboard" />

		<p>Click the <span class="hl">Publish</span> button to create the page.</p>

		<p>The <span class="hl">About</span> page has been created. Click on the <span class="hl">Pages / All Pages</span> menu/tab item in the sidebar menu of the WordPress dashboard to see all pages within the website.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>When you install WordPress, a <span class="hl">Sample Page</span> will be created. This has been removed to keep things simple to just leave the <span class="hl">About us</span> page.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-pages.png" alt="List of pages on the WordPress dashboard" />

		<p>To view the page itself, you can either select the page from the list and click <span class="hl">View Page</span> from the Dashboard header or navigating to the <span class="hl">Permalink</span> URL: <span class="hl">http://localhost/wp-project/about-us/</span></p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-view-page.png" alt="View Page link" />

		<p>The initial <strong>About us</strong> page looks like this:</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-view-about-page.png" alt="The About page" />

		<blockquote>
			<p>Almost everything in WordPress is generated dynamically, including Pages. Everything published in WordPress - <strong>Posts</strong>, <strong>Pages</strong>, <strong>Comments</strong> etc - is stored in the <strong>MySQL</strong> database.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>Update a page</h2>

		<p>If you make any changes to a page, remember to click the <span class="hl">Update</span> button within the <span class="hl">Publish</span> panel in the WordPress dashboard.</p>

		<h2>Create a Post</h2>

		<p>We are now going to create a <span class="hl">Post</span>. This is a very basic process within WordPress. Posts are entries that display in reverse order and usually have comment fields beneath them. This makes posts ideal for blogs and other similar features.</p>

		<p>To begin, login to your WordPress dashboard and go to <span class="hl">Posts / Add New</span>.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-posts.png" alt="WordPress Posts" />

		<p>On this page you will see the WordPress posts editor. The most important parts of this page are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><span class="hl">Post Title</span> - enter the title of your post in this field.</li>
			<li><span class="hl">Post Content</span> - Add content to your post.</li>
		</ul>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-posts-edit.png" alt="WordPress Posts editor" />

		<p>Once you enter the content of your post in WordPress, you need to publish it. Publishing brings your post onto your website. Click the <span class="hl">Publish</span> button to publish your post.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>If you view <span class="hl">All Posts</span>, you will find an example post called <span class="hl">Hello world!</span> This can be removed if you wish as was created when WordPress was installed.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-posts-homepage.png" alt="WordPress Posts on the homepage" />

		<p>The post created should now be displayed on your homepage. The homepage can either be viewed by clicking the <span class="hl">Test WP / Visit Site</span> on the main navigation bar of the WordPress dashboard, or visiting the URL of: <span class="hl">http://localhost/wp-project/</span> in the browser.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-dashboard-navigation.png" alt="WordPress Dashboard navigation" />

		<blockquote>
			<p>For both pages and posts, when a title is added into the title field when a post or page is created, WordPress will clean up the title and generate a user-friendly URL called a <span class="hl">slug</span>. This will compose a <span class="hl">permalink</span> for the page or post created.</p>
		</blockquote> 

		<h2>Post Types</h2>

		<p>WordPress can hold and display many different types of content. Any content added to a WordPress site, usually has a <span class="hl">post type</span>. A <strong>post</strong> is an example of a post type, as are <strong>pages</strong>. WordPress has <strong>several</strong> default post types available when installed. Post types are installed within the <span class="hl">wp_posts</span> table within the <strong>MySQL database</strong>. Posts themselves are placed within a <strong>column</strong> of this table called <span class="hl">post_type</span>.</p>

		<p><span class="hl">Post</span> - in WordPress, the post type of post is typically used for blogs. Posts are normally displayed in reverse order by time with the newest post first. Posts are also used for creating feeds.</p>

		<p><span class="hl">Page</span> - similar to posts, but a page is a post type that is not displayed based on time and can use different page templates.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>You can see the default post types of <strong>Posts</strong> and <strong>Pages</strong>, listed in the <strong>sidebar</strong> of the WordPress dashboard.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-sidebar.png" alt="WordPress Dashboard sidebar" />

		<h2>Custom Post Types (CPT)</h2>

		<p><span class="hl">Custom Post Types</span> are new post types that you can create. A <strong>Custom Post Type (CPT)</strong> is nothing more than a regular post and will be added to the <span class="hl">post_type</span> column (along with any other post type) as a new value in the database. You can create as many custom post types as you wish. Since WordPress evolved from a blogging platform, the term Custom Post Types, has stuck, even though - as mentioned before - they are not used just for posts.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>A Custom Post Type can be added to WordPress by using the <span class="hl">register_post_type()</span> function. The <span class="hl">post_type</span> column in the database is limited to <span class="hl">20 characters</span> and is currently a <span class="hl">VARCHAR</span> field of that length.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>WordPress comes with built-in support for displaying Custom Post Types. When a Custom Post Type is created, it will be added to the <span class="hl">sidebar</span> (<strong>admin panel</strong>) in the WordPress dashboard as a separate menu item with it's own post list and <span class="hl">Add New</span> page. From here you can then <strong>add</strong> and <strong>view</strong> posts within the post type created.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>An example of a Custom Post Type may include <strong>products for online stores</strong>, <strong>property listings for an estate agent</strong> - just a few examples of many you can create.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h3>Create a Custom Post Type</h3>

		<p>To create a Custom Post Type, it is usually recommended to create a <span class="hl">plugin</span>, although you can also use the <strong>functions.php</strong> file within your theme directory - <span class="hl">wp-project/wp-content/themes</span>. As we are currently using the <span class="hl">twentyseventeen</span> theme in the current WordPress install, the file will be located in this theme directory.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>When making changes to the <strong>functions.php</strong> file, do not make any changes to the code currently there. If you want to create a Custom Post Type (CPT), this can be placed at the top or bottom of the file.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Within the <span class="hl">functions.php</span> file, add the following code to the bottom of the file, to create a Custom Post Type (CPT) called <span class="hl">Products</span>.</p>

		<!-- Code example -->
		<div class="code" rel="php" data-title="PHP: wp-project/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/functions.php">
			<pre>
				<code>
<!-- Leave this line empty -->
<span class="syntax-comment">// Custom Post Type function</span>
<span class="syntax-keyword">function</span> create_products_cpt () {

	<span class="syntax-keyword">register_post_type</span>( <span class="syntax-value">'products'</span>,
		<span class="syntax-comment">// CPT options</span>
		array (
			<span class="syntax-property">'labels'</span> => array (
				<span class="syntax-property">'name'</span> => __( <span class="syntax-value">'Products'</span> ),
				<span class="syntax-property">'singular_name'</span> => __( <span class="syntax-value">'Product'</span> )
			),
			<span class="syntax-property">'public'</span> => true,
			<span class="syntax-property">'has_archive'</span> => true,
			<span class="syntax-property">'rewrite'</span> => array ( <span class="syntax-property">'slug'</span> => <span class="syntax-value">'products'</span> )
		)
	);

}

<span class="syntax-comment">// Add the CPT to the theme</span>
<span class="syntax-keyword">add_action</span>( <span class="syntax-value">'init'</span>, <span class="syntax-value">'create_products_cpt'</span> );
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>
		<!-- / Code example -->

		<p>Save the <strong>functions.php</strong> file and the Custom Post Type will be added to the sidebar within the WordPress dashboard.</p>

		<img src="img/wordpress/wp-cpt-added.png" alt="Custom Post Type added to the WordPress dashboard" />

		<p>Because the Custom Post Type has been added to the <span class="hl">functions.php</span> file within a theme, should you change theme, the Custom Post Type will not be available. A <strong>plugin</strong> maybe a more suitable option to use a CPT across multiple templates.</p>
