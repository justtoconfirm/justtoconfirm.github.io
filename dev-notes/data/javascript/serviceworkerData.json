          "A service worker is a script - a file containining JavaScript code - that stands between your website and the network. They provide a cached version of the site when no network connectivity is available, and this also has benefits when using slow or low connectivity. Service worker scripts run in a separate thread in the browser from the pages they control and do not have access to the DOM of those pages. JavaScript code within a service worker must not block. You need to use asynchronous APIs. For example, you cannot use localStorage in a service worker as this is a synchronous API.",
          "This is a foundation of Google's Progressive Web App (PWA) standard that provides potential performance improvements by leveraging the cache for almost instant page loads.",
          "Using a Service worker you can easily set an app to use cached assets first, providing an experience even when offline, before then getting more data from the network. This is commonly known as Offline First. It is also important to note that service worker scripts run on a separate thread in the browser from the pages they control."

You can instruct it to only handle parts of your website ('/my-app/'), or you can register it for your whole website ('/'). This path needs to be written relative to the origin, not your app's root directory. In this example, the worker is at https://github.io/my-app/sw.js and the app's root is https://github.io/my-app/ but the path needs to be written as /my-app/sw.js, not /sw.js"
