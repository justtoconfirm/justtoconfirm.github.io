This means that HTTP itself has no way to keep track of a user's previous activities. Cookies allow a website to store information on a user's machine and later retrieve it. This data is stored in name-value pairs. For example, a website may generate a unique ID number for each visitor and store the ID number on the user's machine using a cookie.",
