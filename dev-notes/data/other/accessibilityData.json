          "The HTML alt (alternative) attribute provides alternative information for an image, if the image cannot be displayed or be seen. This attribute is required for the &lt;img&gt; element. Adding the alt attribute will provide a clear text alternative of the image for screen reader users and users who are unable to see the image (such as a broken image). For screen readers it is recommended to limit the text within the alt attribute to no more than 150 characters.",

Images used for decoration (do not convey content), should have an empty (null) alt tag. Screen readers will simply skip over images with empty alt tags. Examples include:",

          "When adding text to the alt attribute, it is best to avoid phrases such as \"image of ...\" or \"graphic of ...\" to describe the image. It is usually apparent to the user that it is an image. For instance, if we had an image of Barack Obama, we would likely set the alt text as \"Barack Obama\" and not \"Barack Obama, the president of the United States\", as this would likely add extra information not presented directly in the image."
