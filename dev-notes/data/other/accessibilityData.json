For screen readers it is recommended to limit the text within the alt attribute to no more than 150 characters.",

It is usually apparent to the user that it is an image. For instance, if we had an image of Barack Obama, we would likely set the alt text as \"Barack Obama\" and not \"Barack Obama, the president of the United States\", as this would likely add extra information not presented directly in the image."
