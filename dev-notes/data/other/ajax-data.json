          "AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it's possible to update parts of a web page without reloading the whole page. AJAX also allows data to be requested or received after the page has been loaded, and data to be sent to a server in the background. Making partial updates in this way can be effective in creating fluid user experiences and can decrease the load put on the server.",

All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, <abbr title=\"Internet Explorer 7\">IE7</abbr> +) support the XMLHttpRequest object.
