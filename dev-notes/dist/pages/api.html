                <p>API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. It allows two applications to talk to each other.</p>
                <p>Each time you use an application like Facebook or Twitter, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone or desktop, you're using an API. Third party APIs allow you to use a third-party platform, such as Twitter or Facebook, to use some of the platform's functionality in your own applications or webpages. The Twitter API, for example, can be used to display recent Tweets on your web page.</p>
                <p>An API is basically an object that contains properties to store data the API uses, and methods to provide functionality the API makes available.</p>
                <p>We often use HTTP requests to interact with an API.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading section-heading__border-btm">REST &amp; RESTful APIs</h2>
                <p>REST determines what the API looks like. It stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their APIs. The terms REST and RESTful APIs are simply referring to a set of standards that confirm to a specific architectural style. One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL. A request is made to the API and a response is returned.</p>
                <p>The endpoint (or route) is the URL of the API you are requesting. The starting point of an APIs endpoint is called the root-endpoint. Here are a few examples:</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code-block" rel="" data-title="">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
<span class='comment'>// Structure of the root-endpoint</span>
root-endpoint/?

<span class='comment'>// GitHub API root-endpoint</span>
https://api.github.com
<span class='comment'>// Twitter API root-endpoint</span>
https://api.twitter.com
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <!-- / Code example -->
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>When a request to an API is made, the path determines the data (resource) that is returned.</p>
                <p>You need to view the documentation of the API to understand what paths are available. Let's say you want to get a list of repositories for a certain GitHub user using the GitHub API.</p>
                <p>The GitHub API documentation can be found <a href='https://developer.github.com/v3/' target='_blank'>here</a></p>
                <p>The documentation for the API tells you to use the following path:</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code-block" rel="" data-title="">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
/users/<span class='keyword'>:username</span>/repos
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <!-- / Code example -->
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Any colons (:) on a path denotes a variable. You should replace the variable value with an actual value when you send the request. In this example you should replace the variable value with a username of a GitHub user.</p>
                <p>Using my GitHub account as an example, the :username variable will be replaced with justtoconfirm. The endpoint to get all repositories for my GitHub account would be this:</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code-block" rel="" data-title="">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
<span class='comment'>// Replacing the variable with a GitHub account</span>
/users/<span class='keyword'>justtoconfirm</span>/repos

<span class='comment'>// The endpoint to get a list of repositories</span>
https://api.github.com/users/<span class='keyword'>justtoconfirm</span>/repos
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <!-- / Code example -->
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>The final part of an endpoint is the query parameters. Query parameters are not part of the REST architecture, but many APIs use them. They provide you with the option to modify a request with key-value pairs and always begin with a question mark (?). Each parameter pair is then separated with an ampersand (&).</p>
                <p>When you try to get a list of a GitHub user's repositories, you can add parameters to your request to modify the results returned to you.</p>
                <p>If you'd like to get a list of the repositories that recently had commits that were pushed, you can set the value of sort to pushed:</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code-block" rel="" data-title="">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
<span class='comment'>// Example query parameters</span>
?<span class='name'>query1</span>=<span class='value'>value1</span>&<span class='name'>query2</span>=<span class='value'>value2</span>

<span class='comment'>// Getting recent pushes to the GitHub repository</span>
https://api.github.com/users/justtoconfirm/repos?<span class='name'>sort</span>=<span class='value'>pushed</span>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <!-- / Code example -->
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format for sending and requesting data through a REST API. It looks like a JavaScript object. The response that GitHub sends back to you is formatted as JSON. In JSON, each property and value must be wrapped with double quotation marks.</p>
                <p>The method is the type of request you send to the server. You can choose from: POST (Create), GET (Read), PUT/PATCH (Update), and DELETE (Delete) - CRUD. A GET request was used earlier to return details about GitHub repositories. If we wanted to create a new GitHub repository, a POST request would be needed. The API documentation should let you know what request method to use for each request.</p>
                <p>These request methods provide meaning for the request you're making.</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code-block" rel="" data-title="">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
<span class='comment'>// GET request method</span>
<span class='keyword'>GET</span> /users/<span class='keyword'>:username</span>/repos

<span class='comment'>// POST request method</span>
<span class='keyword'>POST</span> /user/repos
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <!-- / Code example -->

            <section>
                <h2 class="section-heading section-heading__border-btm">Authentication</h2>
                <p>When sending a POST request through to GitHub's API, authentication is required because you're not authorised to perform the POST request. Developers put measures in place to ensure you perform actions only when you're authorised to do so. Since POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE requests alter the database, developers will almost always put them behind an authentication wall. In some cases, GET requests may also require authentication.</p>
                <p>Authentication can either be done using a username and password - this is called basic authentication - or with a secret token. The secret token method, such as oAuth, lets you authenticate yourself with social media networks like GitHub, Google, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
                <p>Basic authentication takes the username and password from the client, combine both into a single value, and passes to the server within a HTTP header request. When the server receives this authorisation header, it compares it to stored credentials and if the username and password are a match, the server fulfils the request from the client. If not, a 401 status code is returned to the client confirming that the authentication has failed.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="section-heading section-heading__border-btm">API Updates</h2>
                <p>Developers update their APIs from time to time. Sometimes the developer will change the API so much, that the version will be updated. If this happens, and your application breaks, it's usually because you've written code for an older API, but your request points to the newer API.</p>
                <p>Some APIs will display the version number to the endpoint to make it easier to confirm the version being used.</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code-block" rel="" data-title="">
                    <pre>
