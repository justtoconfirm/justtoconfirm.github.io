                <h3>Declaring a variable</h3>
                <p>A variable is a container for storing a value. To use a variable you first have to create it, or more accurately, this is called declaring a variable.</p>
                <p>To declare a variable we use the var keyword followed by the name you want to call the variable. This name is often called the identifier.</p>
                <p>When a variable is declared without any value it is an empty container. A variable without any value is an undefined variable. When you enter the variable names in the console, you should get a value of undefined returned.</p>
                <p>To assing a value to a variable - also known as initializing a value - we use the assignment operator ( = ). When the variable name is used within the console, it's value will be returned.</p>
                <p>Should a variable not exist, you'll get an error message.</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code" rel="js" data-title="JS">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
// Undefined variable
var myName;
// Output: undefined variable
myName;

// Declaring and initializing a variable
var myName = 'Dan';
// Output: 'Dan'
myName;

// Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: myAge is not defined
myAge;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <!-- / Code example -->
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>When a variable is declared - outside of a function - it becomes part of the window object. The window object is supported by all browsers and represents the browser's window.</p>
                <p>The variable declared is then a global variable and is a property of the window object. By declaring variables globally, conflict can occur as other parts of the JavaScript code can use the same variable.</p>
                <p>It is recommended to not pollute the global namespace by having variables declared globally, but instead, declare them within functions.</p>
                <p>You can take a look at the window object by typing window in the console. This will output the many methods and properties (including any variables we have declared) in the console output.</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code" rel="js" data-title="JS">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
// Declaring and initializing a variable
var myName = 'Dan';

/*
View the window object in the console
Our myName variable will be located within the window object
*/
window
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <!-- / Code example -->
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Once a variable has been declared with a value, the value can be changed/updated by providing a new value.</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code" rel="js" data-title="JS">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
// Declaring and initializing a variable
var myName = 'Dan';
// Change the value
myName = 'Bob';
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <!-- / Code example -->

                <h3>The typeof operator</h3>
                <p>Unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type - numbers, strings, arrays - a variable will contain. This is because JavaScript is a 'loosely typed language'.</p>
                <p>If you were to declare a variable and give it a value within quotes (double or single), the browser will treat the variable as a string. Without any quotes, the value would be a number.</p>
                <p>We can use the special operator called typeof to return the data type of the variable that you pass into it.</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code" rel="js" data-title="JS">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
/*
Declaring and initializing a variable
The value is a string as it's within quotation marks
*/
var myAge = '25';
// Return: 'string'
typeof(myAge);

// Declaring and initializing a variable
var currentYear = 2017;
// Return: 'number'
typeof(currentYear);
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
