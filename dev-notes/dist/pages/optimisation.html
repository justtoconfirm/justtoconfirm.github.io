                <p>Often when we want a link to open in a new tab/window within the browser, we often use the target attribute. However, simply doing this can lead to a potentially serious vulnerability.</p>
                <p>The page opens in a new tab/window, but for a small time, the page or link that has been opened, can potentially have control of the first page (page with the initial link). For example, you have 'Page A' with a link to 'Page B'. The link is clicked and opens 'Page B' within a new tab/window. 'Page B', for a moment, can potentially control 'Page A' using JavaScript.</p>
                <p>This vulnerability is known as 'reverse tabnabbing', and could lead an attacker to download something to your device, intercept data being sent, change cookies, or redirect to any page they wanted.</p>
                <p>The reason this occurs is because it can grant access to the window.opener object of the previous page (where the link is located) and can allow some JavaScript to be executed on the opening page, such as using the window.opener.location object, to redirect the user to a phishing or malicious page. Thankfully, the origin security model of the web prevents it reading your page, but some legacy APIs mean it can navigate your page to a different URL using window.opener.location = newURL.</p>
                <p>Due to the synchronous cross-window access the DOM gives us via window.opener, windows launched using _blank within the target attribute, end up in the same process and thread. This is also true for iFrames and windows opened via window.open. the 'noopener' tag prevents window.opener, so there's no cross-window access. This also has a minor performance benefit.</p>
                <p><ul class='list'><li>noopener - Instructs the browser to open the link without granting the new browsing context access to the document that opened it, by not setting the window.opener property on the opened window, this returns null.</li><li>noreferrer - Prevents the browser, when navigating to another page, from sending the page address or any other value, as a referrer via the Referer: HTTP header.</li></ul></p>
                <p>This is something that can easily be fixed by adding the 'rel' attribute to your links that use the 'target' attribute:</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code-block" rel="html" data-title="HTML">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
&lt;!-- Typical link --&gt;
&lt;a href='#' target='_blank'>Open new tab&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- More Secure --&gt;
&lt;a href='#' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Open new tab&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Support for Firefox and browsers not supporting noopener --&gt;
&lt;a href='#' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Open new tab&lt;/a&gt;
                        </code>

                <p>It is worth noting that Edge doesn't support window.opener for _blank links, so this fix is not necessarily needed for the Edge browser.</p>
                <p>WordPress now automatically adds the 'rel' attribute to links that use the 'target' attribute to open new pages/links in new tabs or windows.</p>
                <p>The fix will potentially affect referrer tracking and some affiliate links. Lost referrer tracking should only be an issue if you have a non-secure http connection. The 'noopener noreferrer' tag should not impact HTTPS transfers (i.e. form your https site to another https site).</p>
                <p>There are a few things you can do to disable the 'noopener noreferrer' issues:</p>
                <p><ul class='list'><li>Avoid using the 'target' attribute on your links. Google recommends you don't use this code in your links if you can avoid it, but for SEO this is often used to boost 'time on page' stats and bounce rate.</li><li>Upgrade your website to HTTPS and only link to sites using HTTPS. All your affiliate links should be HTTPS anyway, and you don't want to run a tracking campaign using HTTP.</li></ul></p>

                <p>HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web to define how messages are formatted and transmitted.</p>
                <p>HTTP Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used for secure communications over a computer network. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS), or by it's predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLS and SSL are used to transport data safely. HTTPS is also sometimes referred to as HTTP over TLS (Transport Layer Security).</p>
                <p>When using HTTP, everything sent between you and a web server is sent in plain text, it is not encrypted and can be intercepted by third parties. HTTPS encrypts this data for security and privacy. This is why HTTPS is used by many sites that require data security such as online shopping and online banking.</p>
                <p>Often within the browser address bar, a small 'padlock' icon will be visible if HTTPS is being used.</p>

                <h2 class="heading padding-btm border-btm">Render Blocking</h2>
                <p>CSS is treated as a render blocking resource. This delays a webpage from being visible in a timely manner and delays the page from rendering. The webpage cannot render until all the CSS files are downloaded and parsed. The bigger your CSS, or the more CSS files you have, the longer the page takes to load and the slower your website will be.</p>
                <p>This is sometimes referred to as the Critical Rendering Path, or 'the things a browser has to do before showing your web page'.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="padding-btm">
                <p>Each CSS file your page uses adds additional time to your webpage loading by requiring an additional file to be called. Combine CSS files into one single file will resolve this issue.</p>
                <p>To combine CSS, you must copy the CSS from one CSS file and paste it into another. You must also remove the call for the original CSS file within your HTML.</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code-block" rel="html" data-title="HTML">

                <p>When including CSS within your HTML, properly label conditional CSS to avoid render blocking. When CSS is not labeled correctly, the browser defaults to loading all CSS before rendering the webpage. By adding the correct label to CSS files being called, the browser then knows that not all CSS is required to begin the page rendering.</p>
                <p>When we include a CSS within the HTML, everything included within the CSS code is loaded by the browser prior to rendering anything at all on your webpage. The more CSS you have, the longer the time it will take to render.</p>
                <p>By using the media attribute we can specify if the browser needs to render the CSS on the page load. The example below has a CSS file using the media attribute of 'print'. Modern browsers will know that this CSS file is not required to render the page. As a result, the browser will place a lower priority to that CSS file. The browser will still download it, but will do so in a manner that does not block rendering.</p>
                <p>When we set a width as the media attribute, modern browsers will understand that this CSS is used in some situations and not used in others, so browsers can choose not to load this CSS file prior to rendering the page if it's not needed.</p>

                <p>When using CSS, try to avoid using @import to call CSS as it adds to the time it takes to load the CSS before your page can load. Any @import used within your CSS calls should be removed and replaced. Rather than using the import method, it is better to just keep the additional CSS within one file.</p>
                <p>CSS imports look like this and will usually be near the top of the file:</p>

                <p>External blocking scripts force the browser to wait for the JavaScript to be fetched, which may add one or more network roundtrips before the page can be rendered. If the external scripts are small, you can inline their contents directly into the HTML document to avoid the network request latency.</p>
                <p>Inlining the script within the HTML eliminates the external request for a JavaScript file and allows the browser to deliver a faster time to first render. Inlining however increases the size of the HTML document and the same JavaScript code may need to be inlined across multiple pages. You should only inline small scripts to deliver best performance.</p>

                <p>By default, JavaScript blocks DOM construction and thus delays the time to first render. To prevent JavaScript from blocking the parser you can use the HTML async attribute on external scripts. Asynchronous JavaScript scripts are not guaranteed to execute in a specified order and should not use document.write . Scripts that depend on execution order or need to access or modify the DOM/CSS of the page, may need to be rewritten to account for these constraints.</p>
                <p>The loading and execution of scripts that are not necessary for the initial page render may be deferred until after the initial render when the page has finished loading. Doing so can help improve performance.</p>

                <p>The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found, and 404 (pronounced as 'four oh four') error message is an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) standard response code. This indicates that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.</p>
                <p>The last '4' in '404' indicates the specific error in the group of '40x', which also includes '400: Bad Request' and '401: Unauthorized'.</p>
                <p>This error simply means that the asset (image, page) cannot be found. This could be due to the asset being missing, or perhaps the path/link to the asset or page is incorrect.</p>
                <p>Often the 404 Not Found error will appear when you are searching for a web page you we're trying to reach. This error is then returned because the page cannot be found on the server. It is a client-side error meaning that either the page has been removed/moved, and the URL was not changed or updated. The error can also appear if you enter the incorrect URL.</p>

                <p>The 500 Internal Server Error is a very general HTTP status code that means something has gone wrong on the website's server (server-side error) but the server could not be more specific on what the exact problem is. This is often a 'catch-all' generic error response. Essentially, the server has encountered an unexpected condition that has prevented it from fulfilling the request. This is a common issue/error during online checkout processes such as when making online purchases.</p>
                <p>This type of error can sometimes be caused due to a syntax error in a .htaccess file on the server. The server logs may indicate what has caused the error to occur and may contain more details about the request to prevent the error from happening again in the future.</p>
                <p>This error maybe temporary, a page refresh or trying the URL once more, may often resolve this issue.</p>

                <h2 class="heading padding-btm border-btm">Minification</h2>
                <p>Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters, including comments and whitespace, from source code without changing it's functionality. This is common in both JavaScript and CSS as it helps to reduce the file size and improve page performance.</p>
                <p>The code is stripped of data that isn't required in order for the file to be executed. This is performed after the code has been written, but before being deployed. Using the minified file in production results in faster response times as less data needs to be processed for each request. This leads to performance gains without compromising the user's experience.</p>
                <p>This process of minification creates a file which is optimised, but harder to read. This often removes whitespace and comments, and shortening of variable names or functions to be more concise. This process only needs to be performed when the source code changes.</p>
                <p>You may see a number of files with the prefix of '.min' suggesting that these files have been minified.</p>

                <p>Within the Chrome DevTools (developer tool) from Chrome 59 and above, you can find unused CSS and JavaScript code with the new Coverage tool.</p>
                <p>To check your version of Chrome, enter the following into your Chrome browser address bar: <a href='chrome://settings/help'>chrome://settings/help</a></p>
                <p>Open the inspector in Chrome and select the menu option (three dots in the top-right corner). Within this menu, select More tools > Coverage. You will need to click the 'record' button to capture coverage of the page.</p>
                <p>Once this has been done, a list of CSS and JavaScript files used throughout the page will be listed confirming how much code is being used. Clicking the file itself will show the code.</p>
                <p>You can also open this tool through the DevTools Command Menu - CMD + SHIFT + P (Mac) or CTRL + SHIFT + P (Windows/Linux) and start typing: Coverage</p>
                <p>Following the command, select 'Show Coverage'</p>
                <p>You can also use the Command Menu to open files within Chrome DevTools using the command: CMD + O (Mac) or CTRL + O (Windows/Linux)</p>
                <p>This is such a useful tool to reduce the size of your pages by removing code that is no-longer required.</p>

                <h2 class="heading padding-btm border-btm">SQL Injection</h2>
                <p>SQL injection attacks are when an attacker uses a web form field or URL parameter to gain access to or to gain access to your database. Without security, it is very easy to use SQL to change tables, delete data, and get information from your database. You can prevent this by always using parameterised queries.</p>
                <!-- Code example -->
                <div class="code-block" rel="" data-title="">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
<!-- Leave space here -->
// SQL query vulnerable to SQL injection
"SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = '" + parameter + "';"

/*
SQL injection
URL parameter changed to pass in 'or '1'='1
additional query can be added to the end of the SQL statement
since '1' is equal to '1'
*/
"SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = '' OR '1'='1';"
                        </code>
                    </pre>

            <section class="padding-btm">
                <p>You could fix this query by explicitly parameterising it. For example, if you we're to use MySQLi in PHP, this should become:</p>

$stmt->execute(array('value' => $parameter));

                <p>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), sometimes known as one-click attack, session riding, or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website</p>
                <p>This type of attack forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated.</p>
                <p>Let's take a contact form on a website. This does not require any user privileges to submit the form. The problems arise when a user with additional privileges would be performing actions not accessible to everyone. This is when CSRF attacks are utilised.</p>
