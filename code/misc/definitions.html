						<h2>A</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - analytics is the collection, reporting, and analysis of website data.</li>
							<li><strong>API</strong> -  stands for <strong>Application Program Interface</strong>, which can be defined as a set of methods of communication between various software components. In other words, an API allows software to communicate.</li>
							<li><strong>Art direction</strong> - change the image displayed to suit different image display sizes.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>B</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Blue/Green deployment</strong> - Ensures we have two production environments, as identical as possible. At any time one of them is live, the other is prepared with a new release of our code. Once the changes have been tested, the router is switched so that all incoming requests go to the other environment and the first environment is now idle. This also allows rapid rollback. If anything goes wrong, we can switch the router back to the initial environment.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>C</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Code Coverage</strong> - testing to determine how much code is being tested. For RSA, our code coverage should be greater than 85.0%.<br>Code Coverage = Number of lines of code exercised/Total number of lines of code * 100% (as a Percentage).</li>
							<li><strong>Code Smell</strong> - also known as bad smell, in code, refers to any symptom in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem. It is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system.</li>
							<li><strong>Compiler</strong> - A compiler converts codes into machine code that the processor can execute. An example could be a C++ compiler.</li>
							<li><strong>CRUD</strong> - Create, Read, Update and Delete.</li>
							<li><strong>CSS</strong> - Cascading Style Sheet</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>D</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Development Environment</strong> - developers are free to change and push changes locally any time in order to quickly test their code and integrate with other changes without fear of breaking anything. This is usually connected to a test database and/or services.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>E</h2>

						<h2>F</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Firefox (FF)</strong> - Web Browser created by Mozilla, formally Netscape.</li>
							<li><strong>FTP</strong> - File Transfer Protocol</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>G</h2>

						<h2>H</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>HTML</strong> - Hypertext Markup Language</li>
							<li><strong>HTTP</strong> - Hypertext Transfer Protocol</li>
							<li><strong>HTTPS</strong> - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>I</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>IDE</strong> - <strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> is a software application used for development and normally consists of at least a source code editor.</li>
							<li><strong>Internet Explorer (IE)</strong> - Web Browser created by Microsoft and replaced by Edge.</li>
							<li><strong>Interpreter</strong> - An interpreter goes through the program line by line and executes each command.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>J</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>JS</strong> - JavaScript</li>
							<li><strong>JSF</strong> - JavaServer Faces</li>
							<li><strong>JSX</strong> - JavaScript XML</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>K</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>KPI</strong> - Key Performance Indicators</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>L</h2>

						<h2>M</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Minification</strong> - the process of reducing code size to reduce the size of our files. JavaScript and CSS files are often minfied to improve page speed/performance.</li>
							<li><strong>Mobile first</strong> - Mobile first is the consideration to think about mobile first and work up to the large desktop screen size.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>N</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>NVM - Node Version Manager</strong>, allows developers to switch Node versions within projects.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>O</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>OOP</strong> - Object-Oriented Progamming</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>P</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>PHP</strong> - PHP Hypertext Preprocessor</li>
							<li><strong>PR</strong> - stands for <strong>Pull Request</strong>, a review of code changes made by the developers that is reviewed by other developers to check for errors and to add comments on improvements that could be made before the code change is merged.</li>
							<li><strong>Pre-production Environment</strong> - usually built before applications go into production. This simulates the actual production environment as closely as possible so we can test the application before it goes into production.</li>
							<li><strong>Production Environment</strong> - the live environment.</li>
							<li><strong>Programming Language</strong> - a programming language is just a set of predefined rules. To make them useful, we need something to understand those rules. Those things are compilers & interpreters.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Q</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>QA</strong> - stands for <strong>Quality Assurance</strong> and is a way of preventing mistakes and defects during software testing.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>R</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Responsive Web Design (RWD)</strong> - originally defined by Ethan Marcotte, is the approach in design and development to respond to a user's behaviour and environment based on screen size, platform, and orientation. Responsive design is an approach to creating websites in which the layout adapts to fit the device's screen.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>S</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Sass</strong> - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets</li>
							<li><strong>SCSS</strong> - Sassy CSS</li>
							<li><strong>Staging Environment</strong> - similar to UAT but setup with a copy of production data, sometimes anonymised. The primary focus of the Staging environment is to ensure that the application will work in production the same way it worked in UAT. Staging environments is a testing environment dedicated to QA or software testers to review changes. This environment is used to typically test the whole app.</li>
							<li><strong>SQL</strong> - SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el" or "see-quel") stands for <strong>Structured Query Language</strong> and is used to communicate with databases. SQL is a database management language for Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Postgres and SQL Server.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>T</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>TS</strong> - TypeScript</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>U</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>UAT</strong> - stands for <strong>User Acceptance Testing</strong> and is the environment in which user acceptance testing is performed. It should contain a "as good as possible" copy of the production environment. The UAT environment is connected to UAT databases with a copy of production data and is used by the QA team and users to validate changes before they reach production.</li>
							<li><strong>UI</strong> -  User Interface</li>
							<li><strong>UX</strong> - User Experience</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>V</h2>

						<h2>W</h2>
