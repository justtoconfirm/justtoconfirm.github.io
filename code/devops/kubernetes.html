						<h2>What is Kubernetes?</h2>

						<p>Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for automating the management, placement, scaling and routing of containers. It is a container management system developed on the Google platform. It was first developed by Google and contributed to open source in 2014. It is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.</p>

						<p>Modern applications are increasingly built using containers, which are microservices packaged with their dependencies and configurations.</p> 

						<p>Kubernetes helps to manage containerised applications in virtual and cloud environments. It is a flexible container tool to consistently deliver complex applications running on clusters of hundreds to thousands of individual servers.</p>

						<p>Kubernetes helps to control the resource allocation and traffic management for cloud applications and microservices. It also includes:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Automated Scheduling</li>
							<li>Automated rollouts and rollback</li>
							<li>Horizontal scaling & load balancing</li>
						</ul>

						<p><strong>Docker Desktop</strong> includes: Docker Apps, developer tools, and Kubernetes</p>

						<h3>What is a Container?</h3>

						<p>Today's Internet users never accept downtime, therefore, developers have to find a method to perform maintenance and updates without interrupting their services. A container, which is an isolated environment, includes everything needed for the application to run. It makes it easy for developers to edit and deploy apps. Containers have become the preferred method for packaging, deploying, and updating web apps.</p>

						<p>With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times a day. Containers enable applications to be released and updated without downtime.</p>

						<p>Kubernetes is similar to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Swarm</a>.</p>
